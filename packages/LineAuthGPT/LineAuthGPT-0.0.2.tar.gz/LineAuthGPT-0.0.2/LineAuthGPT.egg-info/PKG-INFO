- This project is not built from scratch by me, I just modified, improved and fixed the original code of [pyChatGPT](https://github.com/terry3041/pyChatGPT) since I noticed there were already some PRs and they were not responded to by the terry3041. I also added some new features to the package, and will keep on doing so.
