"""
Unstable Populations: has your data drifted?

Measuring whether your data has drifted through:
- UPI: the Unstable Population Indicator: upi()
- PSI: the Population Stability Index: psi()

When two populations are supplied (see help of the functions for 
more details), a (in)stability index is returned. Very low numbers
(rule of thumb! Test for yourself!) of <~0.1 indicate that the 
distributions in both populations are the same, while larger 
numbers indicate larger difference between the two distributions.

    either categories or bins (the bins can be made by the function).

    Comparison can be weighted by number, such that
    bins with many elements are weighted heavier.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pop1, pop2
        list, numpy.ndarray, dict, pandas.Series or pandas.DataFrame
        containing the first and population, respectively.
        They need to be of the same type. When they are:
        - list/numpy.ndarray: either the full population (ints or floats)
            that need to be binned (bin_data=True) or an ordered sequence of
            (unnamed) categories/bins with bin counts or fractions of the
            population in the bin or category.
        - dict: dictionary with category names or bin values as keys and count
            or fractions in those categories/bins as values. The two populations
            will be matched based on keys and non-existing categories in either
            population will be added with value 0.
        - pandas.Series: Series with category names or bin values as index and
            count or fractions in those categories/bins as values. The two
            populations will be matched based on index and non-existing
            categories in either population will be added with value 0.
        - pandas.DataFrame: need to have only one column, will be converted to
            Series, see definition of Series above.
        All values that indicate a count or fraction are taken as is (no
        consistency check on data type and normalization) and will be normalized
        to sum to 1 (i.e. converted into fractions)

    weight, optional
        Boolean indicating whether weighting by bin values is done,
        by default True
    bin_data, optional
        Boolean indicating whether data should be binned first,
        by default False
    bins, optional
        When bin_data=True, this keyword indicates how binning is done, as
        performed by numpy.histogram. It accepts an integer (number of bins),
        list/numpy.ndarray with bin edges, a string indicating the method
        (see numpy.histogram_bin_edges for documentation), by default 10
    verbose, optional
        Boolean indicating whether extra information should be printed,
        by default False

    Returns
    -------
        UPI, a floating point number indicating the instability of the
        population, going from one to the other (it is symmetric).
        Rule of thumb: UPI<0.1 indicates a similar distribution.
