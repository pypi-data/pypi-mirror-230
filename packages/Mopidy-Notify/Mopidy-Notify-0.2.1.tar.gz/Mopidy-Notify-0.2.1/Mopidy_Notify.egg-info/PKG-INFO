Mopidy extension for showing desktop notifications on track change.


Installation
============

Install by running::

    python3 -m pip install Mopidy-Notify

See https://mopidy.com/ext/notify/ for alternative installation methods.


Configuration
=============

Before starting Mopidy, you must add configuration for
Mopidy-Notify to your Mopidy configuration file::

    [notify]
    enabled = true

The following configuration values are available:

:literal:`notify/max_icon_size`:
    Maximum icon dimensions (width/heigh) in pixels for which track images/album covers are fetched.
    For some tracks, images in multiple dimensions are available.
    Mopidy-Notify will try to use the largest image possible for a notification.
    Since some backends provide huge track images (as large as 3000x3000 pixels for Bandcamp MP3s), use this value to restrict which images are considered for display.
    If no track images are smaller than :literal:`max_icon_size`, the smallest image available will be used.

:literal:`notify/fallback_icon`:
    File path to an icon or the name of a default icon used as fallback if no track image/album cover is available for the currently playing track.

:literal:`notify/track_summary`:
    A `template string <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings>`_ used to build a notification summary.
    See below for values substituted.

:literal:`notify/track_message`:
    Same as :literal:`track_summary`, but supplies the more detailed message content of a notification.

The following values are set by default::

    [notify]
    enabled = true
    max_icon_size = 200
    fallback_icon = notification-audio-play
    track_summary = ${track}
    track_message = ${artists} â€” ${album}


The following variables are substituted for properties of the currently playing track when encountered in an template string:

:literal:`$track`:
    Name of the currently playing track.
:literal:`$album`:
    The album in which this track is contained.
:literal:`$artists`, :literal:`$composers`, :literal:`$performers`:
    Comma separated list of artists/composers/performers for this track.
:literal:`$genre`:
    This track's genre.
:literal:`$time`:
    The current running time of this track, formatted `[HH:]MM:SS`.
    Hours are omitted of running time is below one hour.
:literal:`$date`:
    Release date.
:literal:`$bitrate`:
    Track bitrate in `kbit/s`.
:literal:`$comment`:
    Track comment.
:literal:`$musicbrainz_id`:
    Musicbrainz ID.
