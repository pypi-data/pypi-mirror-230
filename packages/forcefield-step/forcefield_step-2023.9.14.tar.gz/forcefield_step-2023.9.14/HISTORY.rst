History

2023.9.14 -- Fixed errors! And added C2mim to test.
  * The units of the torsions were incorrect in the last implementation.
  * Added parameters for 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations from JCP 108, 2038 (2004)
  * Tested much more thoroughly.

2023.9.13 -- Added parameters for TFSI to  CL&P/OPLSAA
  * Parameters for TFSI - bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide

2023.9.8 -- Added more typing for OPLS-AA
  * cyclopropane -CH2-, -CHR-, and -CR2-
  * hexafluorobenzene
  * difluorobenzene
  * bromobenzene
  * iodobenzene
  * thiophenol
  * alkyl nitriles
  * nitroalkanes
  * nitrobenzene
  * methylene in phenylacetonitrile
  * corrections to methylene nitrile anion

2023.9.7 -- Added typing in OPLS_AA for fluorobenzene

2023.9.6 -- Fixed issue with PF6- geometry
  * The Lennard-Jones repulsive term added to the F-P-F angle was too weak, allowing the
    structure to get trapped in a symmetric state with ~40º angles.

2023.8.27 -- Fixed issue with angle in octahedral systems
  * The SHAPES-type simple fourier potential used for octahedral complexes has a fals
    minimim at 0º. Added a LJ 1/R^12 repulsive term between the two end atoms of the
    angle to prevent small angles. This required using tabulated potentials in LAMMPS.
    
2023.5.1 -- Fixed bug in Lithium battery forcefield
  * Fixed a typo in the angle type unit line which caused a crash
    
2023.4.6 -- Added Lithium battery forcefield
  * An initial set of parameters for cathode materials, specifically LiCoO2.

2023.2.13 -- Added OPLS-AA forcefield
  * Added parameters for OPLS-AA along with some extra parameters for ionic liquids
    * PF6-
    * ethylene carbonate (EC) and fluoronated EC (FEC)
  * Added atom-typing templates for most of OPLS-AA. Still missing a few and amino
    acids and DNA not yet tested.
  * Added extensive, almost-complete testing, for OPLS-AA
    

2021.2.10 (10 February 2021)
----------------------------

* Updated the README file to give a better description.
* Updated the short description in setup.py to work with the new installer.
* Added keywords for better searchability.

2020.8.1 (1 August 2020)
------------------------

* Added support for OpenKIM potentials in LAMMPS

0.9.1 (24 May 2020)
-------------------

* Added the specialized NaCl_water forcefield for testing the MolSSI
  Driver Interface (MDI) metadynamics driver.

0.9 (15 April 2020)
-------------------

* Internal changes for compatibility
  
0.1.0 (24 December 2017)
------------------------

* First release on PyPI.
