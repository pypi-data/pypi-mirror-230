### Desktop Images
Allows users to select different image files to use as desktop background during dawn, day, dust and night.
A single image can be selected for each period or the app can be set to shuffle images from the selected image's folder.

### Transition Times
The app determines image transition times based on sunrise and sunset times at the users location.
This is calculated using two non-standard library Python modules:
- [Geocoder](https://github.com/DenisCarriere/geocoder) - Retrieves the users location and timezone using their IP address.
- [Astral](https://sffjunkie.github.io/astral/) - Calculates sunrise and sunset times based on user location and the current date.

Alternatively, the user can select their own times for images to transition.

### Preferences
The app offers three additional options:
- Dark Theme - Toggles the GUI between light and dark theme.
- Minimize to tray - When selected the app will minimize to the system tray and continue running, instead of shutting down when the window in closed.
- Run on startup - The app to run in the background when the computer is started.

## Running with Python

### Installation

Circadian Desktops can be installed as a library module from PyPI:
```
python -m pip install circadian_desktops
```

### Usage

It is recommended to run Circadian Desktops with `pythonw.exe` to avoid having a command prompt hanging. With Circadian Desktops installed in Python's library packages, run:
```
pythonw -m circadian_desktops
```

## Building executable

An executable version of Circadian Desktops can be built from source using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

First, install all dependancies in `requirements.txt`, plus the PyInstaller package. Then from this folder run:

```
pyinstaller app.spec
```

This will produce `dist\app` folder containing `Circadian Desktops.exe`.
