==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the AsyncAPI specification:

- Use AsyncAPI 2.6.0 specification.
- Construct the specification in this order: asyncapi, info, servers, channels, components.
- Set info.version as 0.0.1.
- Extract content within "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" and use it in the app description section, beginning with "A FastStream application which" and explain the app's purpose clearly and concisely. Always enclose the description in double quotes
- Create a concise, meaningful info.title based on the extracted app description.
- For methods decorated with @broker.subscriber and @broker.publisher, carefully review the "==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====" section step-by-step. Create a clear description outlining the business logic that should be implemented by each consumer and producer. Ensure the description provides sufficient clarity for software developers to effectively implement the required functionality. Exclude redundant details between different producers or consumers.

Please respond with a valid AsyncAPI spec only in YAML format. No other text should be included in the response.

==== APP DESCRIPTION: ====
"""

# %% ../../nbs/Prompts.ipynb 4
APP_SKELETON_GENERATION_PROMPT = """


Generate skeleton code for FastStream applications based on provided app descriptions in the "==== USER APP DESCRIPTION ====" section, adhering to these guidelines:

    - For methods decorated with @broker.subscriber and @broker.publisher, avoid implementing business logic. Instead, write "raise NotImplementedError()" and create Google-style docstrings to describe their intended functionality when handling received or produced messages. In each docstring, include a clear instruction to "log the consumed message using logger.info" for subscriber functions.

    - Ensure the generated code aligns with the specific app description requirements.

    - Provide a clear and organized starting point for developers.

    - Your response must contain only valid Python code, saveable as a .py script; no additional text is allowed.


The goal is to offer developers a structured starting point that matches the example app descriptions, aiding in FastStream application development. Follow the example patterns provided for reference.

==== INSTRUCTIONS: ====

Instructions you must follow while generating the FastKafka code from the AsyncAPI specification:

- Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
- Write optimised ans readable Code
- Use Pydantic V2! In this version, Pydantic.Field attribute 'regex' is replaced with 'pattern'!
- Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.
- DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
- Make sure to import create_ssl_context from aiokafka.helpers while implementing "SASL_SSL" security protocol
- All the attributes of the Message class should be assigned with an instance of Field class with appropriate values. It cannot be a primitive type (e.g., str, int, float, bool). 
- Don't ever put "pass" or "#TODO" comments in the implementation. Instead, always write real implementation!
- Never ever update or modify the msg object directly in the consumes or produces function. Always create a new instance of the msg object and make only necessary updates. Example:
    ```python
        @greetings_app.consumes(topic="receive_name", description=receive_name_description)
        async def on_receive_name(msg: Greetings):
            msg = Greetings(user_name = f"Hello {msg.user_name}") # always create a new instance of the msg class and do not modify the msg parameter directly.
            await to_send_greetings(msg)
    ```
    

==== INPUT ASYNC SPECIFICATION: ====

"""

# %% ../../nbs/Prompts.ipynb 7
TEST_GENERATION_PROMPT = '''

Testing FastStream apps:

The FastStream apps can be tested using the TestBroker context managers which, by default, puts the Broker into "testing mode".

The Tester will redirect your subscriber and publisher decorated functions to the InMemory brokers so that you can quickly test your app without the need for a running broker and all its dependencies.

Now, Generate test code for FastStream application based on provided application code in the "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION ====" section, adhering to these guidelines:

    - You need to generate test code for the application code mentioned in ==== APP IMPLEMENTATION ====
    - Your response must contain only valid Python code, saveable as a .py script; no additional text is allowed.
    - Output only the test code. DO not repeat the code in "==== APP IMPLEMENTATION: ====" section.
    - IMPORT ALL NECESSARY DEPENDENCIES FROM THE application in the test code, this is realy important!
    - YOU NEED TO IMPORT ALL NECESSARY DEPENDENCIES FROM THE 'application.py' in the test code, this is realy important!
    - Follow the PEP 8 Style Guide for Python while writing the code
    - Write optimised and readable Code
    - Output only a valid executable python code. No other extra text should be included in your response.
    - DO NOT enclose the response within back-ticks. Meaning NEVER ADD ```python to your response.
    - Always start tests with: 'async with TestKafkaBroker(broker):'

Below are few examples for your understanding:

==== RELEVANT EXAMPLES GOES HERE ====

Here are common issues and their potential fixes. You can use this information as an additional reference while fixing the code.:

==== Error ==== 

AssertionError: Expected 'mock' to not have been called. Called 2 times.

==== ERROR CODE ==== 
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker):
        await broker.publish(DataBasic(data=0.2), "input_data")

        on_input_data.mock.assert_called_with(dict(DataBasic(data=0.2)))
        on_output_data.mock.assert_not_called() # ERROR IN THIS LINE

==== FIXED CODE ==== 

    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker):
        await broker.publish(DataBasic(data=0.2), "input_data")

        on_input_data.mock.assert_called_with(dict(DataBasic(data=0.2)))
