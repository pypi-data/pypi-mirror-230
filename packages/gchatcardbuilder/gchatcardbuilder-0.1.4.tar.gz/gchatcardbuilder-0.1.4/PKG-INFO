## Description
Gchat Card Builder provides an easy-to-use interface for creating richly formatted cards compatible with Google Chat. The goal is to stop mucking around with deeply nested structures just to send a slightly rich chat message.

Here's an example of how this could help clean up code:

```python
# broken onto several lines for readability
gchat_response = copy.deepcopy(BIG_OLD_DICT_TEMPLATE)
widgets = gchat_response["cardsV2"][0]["card"]["sections"][0]["widgets"]
button = widgets[0]["buttonList"]["buttons"][0]
button["text"] = "click to get rick rolled"
button["onClick"]["openLink"]["url"] = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"
```

becomes this:

```python
builder = CardBuilder.create()
builder.add_section(
    W.ButtonList(
        buttons=[
            W.Button(
                text="click to get rick rolled",
                onClick=W.OnClick(
                    openLink=W.OpenLink(
                        url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ',
                    )
                )
            )
        ]
    ),
)

gchat_response = builder.build()
```
