"""
Assume that all related libraries or contracts are in a single file.
This is critical to using source mapping to get back the source code.

When in a single file, I can preprocess this single file and git it to the solc. The result is that I can correctly get back the source code for each entity.

When libraries or contracts are scattered in different files, I can not preprocess them without some effort ( the effort to find the related files and give the preprocessed files to solc.)

If the files are not processed, the code I get based on the source mapping misses some characters at the beginning. I guess solc compiles based on a slightly different version (of course, the code of contracts is not changed). I do not have time to explore this at this moment. So, right now, I just assume that all the required code is in a single file.

multiple files -> multiple SourceUnit nodes
one file -> one SourceUnit node
