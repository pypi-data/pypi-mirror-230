# Botright v0.3

## Install it from PyPI

```bash
pip install botright
playwright install
```

---

## Usage

### Botright is currently only available in async mode.
### It is fully plugable with your existing playwright code. You only have to change your browser initialization!

```py
import asyncio

import botright


async def main():
    botright_client = await botright.Botright(headless=False)
    browser = await botright_client.new_browser()
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Continue by using the Page
    await page.goto("https://google.com")

    await botright_client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Browser Stealth

Botright uses a vast amount of techniques to hide its functionality as a bot from websites.
To enhance stealth, since Version 0.3, it uses a real Chromium-based browser from the local machine to start up a botted browser.
Furthermore, it scrapes information about the browser and from the internet, to build up a fake browser fingerprint and to deceive website into thinking it is legit.

## Captcha Solving

Botright is able to solve a wide viarity of Captchas.
For Documentation of these functions visit [BotrightDocumentation](botright.md).

It uses Computer Vision/Artificial Intelligence and other Methods to solve these Captchas.

You dont need to pay for any Captcha Solving APIs and you can solve Captchas with just one simple function call.

Here all Captchas supported as of now:

| Captcha Type | Supported |            Solved By            | Success Rate |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:-------------------------------:|--------------|
