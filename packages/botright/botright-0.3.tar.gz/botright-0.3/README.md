```py
import asyncio

import botright


async def main():
    botright_client = await botright.Botright(headless=False)
    browser = await botright_client.new_browser()
    page = await browser.new_page()

    # Continue by using the Page
    await page.goto("https://google.com")

    await botright_client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Browser Stealth

Botright uses a vast amount of techniques to hide its functionality as a bot from websites.
To enhance stealth, since Version 0.3, it uses a real Chromium-based browser from the local machine to start up a botted browser.
Furthermore, it scrapes information about the browser and from the internet, to build up a fake browser fingerprint and to deceive website into thinking it is legit.
