        ## How to use
        
        ### Match Stats
        
        You can fetch all the matches that occured on a particular date like:
        
        ``` python
        matches = fetch_matches(date="20230101")
        ```
        
            Fetching matches on date:20230101...
            No match information for matches played on 20230101 either because no matches took place or rugbypy does not have access to the match data. Please raise if neither.
        
        ``` python
        match_details = fetch_match_details(match_id="595735")
        ```
        
            Fetching match details for match_id:595735...
            Error fetching match data - name 'pd' is not defined. Please raise an issue!
        
        ### Team Stats
        
        ``` python
        from rugbypy.team import fetch_team_stats
        ```
        
        ### Player Stats
