Generate dummy Git repositories and populate them with the desired number of commits, branches, merges, and structure.

Example: `$ git-dummy --commits=10 --branches=4 --merge=1`

This will initialize a new Git repo in the current directory with 4 branches, each containing 10 commits, 1 of which is merged back into `main`.

Note: All generated dummy repos have at minimum 1 branch called `main`. For dummies with multiple branches, branches are named `branch1, branch2, ..., branchN`. Each branch currently branches off of `main` at `--diverge-at` if supplied, or else a randomly chosen commit. The length of each branch is capped at the number of commits specified by `--commits`. Use `--merge=x,y,...,n` to select which branches get merged back into `main`. 

## Use cases
- Programatically generate Git repos for functional testing of Git tools
- Decide how many commits and branches are generated
- Select which branches get merged back into `main`
- Mimic scenarios in real Git repos to practice on without touching real data
- Generate Git demo repos to teach or learn from

## Features
- Run a one-liner git-dummy command in the terminal to generate a dummy Git repo based on your parameters
- Customize the repo name, path, number of commits, branches, merges, and structure

## Quickstart

1) Install `git-dummy`:

```console
$ pip install git-dummy
```

2) Browse to the directory you want to create your dummy Git repo in:

```console
$ cd path/to/dummy/parent
```

3) Run the program:

```console
$ git-dummy [options]
```

4) A new Git repo called `dummy` will be initialized and populated based on the supplied parameters.

5) See global help for list of global options/flags and subcommands:

```console
$ git-dummy -h
```

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or greater
* Pip (Package manager for Python)

## Command options and flags
Available options and flags include:

`--name`: The name of the dummy Git repo, defaults to "dummy".  
`--commits`: The number of commits to populate in the dummy Git repo, defaults to 5.  
`--branches`: The number of branches to generate in the dummy Git repo, defaults to 1.  
`--diverge-at`: The commit number at which branches diverge from `main`.  
`--merge`: A comma separated list of branch postfix ids to merge back into `main`.  
`--git-dir`: The path at which to store the dummy Git repo, defaults to current directory.  
`--no-subdir`: Initialize the dummy Git repo in the current directory instead of in a subdirectory.  
`--constant_sha`: Use constant values for commit author, email, and commit date parameters to yield consistent sha1 values across git-dummy runs.  
`--allow-nested`: Allow dummy repo creation within an existing Git repo, as long as it's not at the level of an existing .git/ folder.

## Command examples
Generate a dummy Git repo called "cheese" on your Desktop, with 2 branches and 10 commits on each branch:

```console
$ git-dummy --name=cheese --branches=2 --commits=10 --git-dir=~/Desktop
```

Generate a dummy repo with 4 branches `main`, `branch1`, `branch2`, and `branch3`. Branches diverge from `main` after the 2nd commit:

```console
$ git-dummy --branches=4 --diverge-at=2
```

Generate a dummy repo with 4 branches, so that `branch1` and `branch3` are merged back into `main`:

```console
$ git-dummy --branches=4 --merge=1,3
```

For convenience, environment variables can be set for any command-line option available in git-dummy. All environment variables start with `git_dummy_` followed by the name of the option.

For example, the `--git-dir` option can be set as an environment variable like:

```console
$ export git_dummy_git_dir=~/Desktop
```

Similarly, the `--name` option can be set like:

```console
$ export git_dummy_name=cheese
```

In general:

```console
$ export git_dummy_option_name=option_value
```

Explicitly specifying options at the command-line takes precedence over the corresponding environment variable values.
