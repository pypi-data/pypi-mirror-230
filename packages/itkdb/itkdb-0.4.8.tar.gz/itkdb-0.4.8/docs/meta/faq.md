## Requests

**_Q_**: I'm getting an SSL Error when making a request to url containing
`cern.ch`.

**_A_**: If you run into SSL errors with CERN websites, you might need the CERN
certificate chain to sign the certificates correctly. Just add a `verify`
keyword into your calls:

```py
client.get(..., verify=itkdb.data / "CERN_chain.pem")
```

and it should work.

**_Q_**: How do I upload a file to EOS?

**_A_**: To upload a file to EOS, you need to install this package with the
[`eos` feature](../install.md). Then refer to some [examples](../examples.md)
for usage.

**_Q_**: I got an `ImportError` related to `pycurl` and `libcurl`. How do I fix
this?

**_A_**: If you try running `itkdb` and run into an issue like:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ImportError: pycurl: libcurl link-time ssl backends (secure-transport, openssl) do not include compile-time ssl backend (none/other)
```

You will need to reinstall pycurl and force re-compilation. This can be done by
first checking the config for `curl` on your machine:

```shell hl_lines="12"
$ curl-config --features
AsynchDNS
GSS-API
HTTPS-proxy
IPv6
Kerberos
Largefile
MultiSSL
NTLM
NTLM_WB
SPNEGO
SSL
UnixSockets
alt-svc
libz
```

and then setting the appropriate compile flags. For example, the above shows I
have `SSL` enabled, if I have `openssl` then...

=== "Mac OSX"

    ``` bash
    $ brew info openssl
    ...
    ...

    For compilers to find openssl@3 you may need to set:
      export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib"
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/include"

    ...
    ```

    which tells me to export the above lines and then I can reinstall correctly:

    ``` bash
    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/lib"
    $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl@3/include"
    $ python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --compile --ignore-installed --install-option="--with-openssl" pycurl
    ```

=== "lxplus (CC7)"

    Assuming a virtual environment like

    ``` bash
    $ lsetup "views dev4 latest/x86_64-centos7-gcc11-opt"
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    I looked up the locations of the installations on lxplus for you already:

    ``` bash
    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/openssl"
    $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/openssl"
    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/lib/pkgconfig/
    $ python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --compile --ignore-installed --install-option="--with-nss" pycurl
    ```

=== "SWAN [lxplus (CC7)]"

    Assuming a virtual environment like

    ``` bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    which came with `python3.9` by default on [swan](https://swan.cern.ch), the
    installation flags needed are:

    ``` bash
    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib64/openssl"
    $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/include/openssl"
    $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/lib64/pkgconfig/
    $ python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --compile --ignore-installed --install-option="--with-nss" pycurl
    ```

Additional note that if you have `pip >= 23.0`, you will need to modify the
commands above to supply:

```bash
--no-use-pep517 --global-option="--with..."
```

instead of using `--install-option` which is deprecated in favor of
`--global-option`, and disabling the use of PEP517 to allow the use of
`--global-option`.

Also be sure that you have the curl headers installed (e.g. via `libcurl-devel`)
on your machine.

## Potpourri

**_Q_**: I'm still stuck and I don't see my question here.

**_A_**: I'm still working on fleshing out the FAQs. Check back soon. In the
meantime, file an [issue][].
