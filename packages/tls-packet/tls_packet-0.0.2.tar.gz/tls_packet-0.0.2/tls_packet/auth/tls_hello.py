#    The TLS Handshake Protocol is one of the defined higher-level clients
#    of the TLS Record Protocol.  This protocol is used to negotiate the
#    secure attributes of a session.  Handshake messages are supplied to
#    the TLS record layer, where they are encapsulated within one or more
#    TLSPlaintext structures, which are processed and transmitted as
#    specified by the current active session state.


class TLSHelloRequest(TLSHandshake):
    """
        When this message will be sent:

          The HelloRequest message MAY be sent by the server at any time.

        Meaning of this message:

          HelloRequest is a simple notification that the client should begin
          the negotiation process anew.  In response, the client should send
          a ClientHello message when convenient.  This message is not
          intended to establish which side is the client or server but
          merely to initiate a new negotiation.  Servers SHOULD NOT send a
          HelloRequest immediately upon the client's initial connection.  It
          is the client's job to send a ClientHello at that time.

          This message will be ignored by the client if the client is
          currently negotiating a session.  This message MAY be ignored by
          the client if it does not wish to renegotiate a session, or the
          client may, if it wishes, respond with a no_renegotiation alert.
          Since handshake messages are intended to have transmission
          precedence over application data, it is expected that the
          negotiation will begin before no more than a few records are
          received from the client.  If the server sends a HelloRequest but
          does not receive a ClientHello in response, it may close the
          connection with a fatal alert.

          After sending a HelloRequest, servers SHOULD NOT repeat the
          request until the subsequent handshake negotiation is complete.

        Structure of this message:

          struct { } HelloRequest;

        This message MUST NOT be included in the message hashes that are
        maintained throughout the handshake and used in the Finished messages
        and the certificate verify message.
