    Client Key Exchange Message

      This message is always sent by the client.  It MUST immediately
      follow the client certificate message, if it is sent.  Otherwise,
      it MUST be the first message sent by the client after it receives
      the ServerHelloDone message.

      With this message, the premaster secret is set, either by direct
      transmission of the RSA-encrypted secret or by the transmission of
      Diffie-Hellman parameters that will allow each side to agree upon
      the same premaster secret.

      When the client is using an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponent,
      then this message contains the client's Diffie-Hellman public
      value.  If the client is sending a certificate containing a static
      DH exponent (i.e., it is doing fixed_dh client authentication),
      then this message MUST be sent but MUST be empty.

      The choice of messages depends on which key exchange method has
      been selected.  See Section 7.4.3 for the KeyExchangeAlgorithm
      definition.

        For all key exchange methods, the same algorithm is used to convert
        the pre_master_secret into the master_secret.  The pre_master_secret
        should be deleted from memory once the master_secret has been
        computed.

        The master secret is always exactly 48 bytes in length.  The length
        of the premaster secret will vary depending on key exchange method.

        RSA

           When RSA is used for server authentication and key exchange, a 48-
           byte pre_master_secret is generated by the client, encrypted under
           the server's public key, and sent to the server.  The server uses its
           private key to decrypt the pre_master_secret.  Both parties then
           convert the pre_master_secret into the master_secret, as specified
           above.

        Diffie-Hellman

           A conventional Diffie-Hellman computation is performed.  The
           negotiated key (Z) is used as the pre_master_secret, and is converted
           into the master_secret, as specified above.  Leading bytes of Z that
           contain all zero bits are stripped before it is used as the
           pre_master_secret.

           Note: Diffie-Hellman parameters are specified by the server and may
           be either ephemeral or contained within the server's certificate.
