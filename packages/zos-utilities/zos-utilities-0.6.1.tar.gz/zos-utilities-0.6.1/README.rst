Library for performing various utility functions needed for z/OS libraries. I have a couple of libraries that do
various things for/with z/OS, and they all need to convert from the z/OS Julian Date to datetime, so I thought I might
as well put it into a library.  I'm also starting to build a representation of z/OS and IBM Z from an infrastructure
perspective.
