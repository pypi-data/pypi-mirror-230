# Harmon Chess Engine

<!-- ![Harmon Chess Engine Logo](./images/logo.png) -->

Harmon Chess Engine is a cutting-edge chess engine that leverages the power of transformer-based machine learning models to revolutionize the world of computer chess. Unlike traditional chess engines, Harmon is designed to understand and exploit human mistakes, making it a formidable opponent for chess players of all levels.

## Features

- **Transformer-Powered Chess Engine**: Harmon uses state-of-the-art transformer models to predict human moves, allowing it to adapt its strategy based on the tendencies and mistakes commonly made by human players.

- **Human Mistake Exploitation**: Harmon's unique approach allows it to identify and capitalize on common human errors, giving it a strategic advantage in games.

- **Game Analysis**: Analyze your chess games to gain insights into your playing style and improve your skills. Harmon can provide detailed game summaries, identify key turning points, and suggest areas for improvement.

- **Elo Prediction**: Harmon can estimate the Elo rating of chess players based on their game performance, helping players gauge their progress and understand their strengths and weaknesses.

- **Game Outcome Prediction**: Harmon can predict the likely outcome of a chess game, providing players with valuable insights into the flow and dynamics of the match.
