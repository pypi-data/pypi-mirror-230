Prerequisites - System packages (easy to install)
-------------------------------------------------

Some functionalities of ``slabbe`` package depend on the installation of
packages on the system such as libpari-dev, pdflatex, lualatex (lualatex
compiles large tikzpicture exceeding the memory limits of pdflatex), pdf2svg as
well as softwares including ImageMagick__ (to convert pdf to png so that
tikzpicture appear directly in the Jupyter notebook), Graphviz__ (to draw
graphs). 

__ https://imagemagick.org/
__ https://graphviz.org/

On Debian or Ubuntu, one may do::

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libpari-dev -y
    sudo apt install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-luatex texlive-fonts-extra -qy
    sudo apt install graphviz imagemagick pdf2svg -y

The installation of imagemagick done above provides the command ``convert`` but
it does not *allow* to convert pdf to png unless you edit the Imagemagick's
``policy.xml`` file which can be done as follows (thanks to `Naveed's comment
on stackoverflow`__)::

    sudo sed -i '/PDF/s/none/read|write/' /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml

__ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42928765/

On **OSX**, one should first `install Homebrew`__. Then one can install the
above packages similarly as above using ``brew`` instead of ``apt``::

    sudo brew install graphviz imagemagick pdf2svg

__ https://brew.sh/

Prerequisites - SageMath optional packages
------------------------------------------

Installing slabbe requires a working SageMath installation (with Cython and
gcc). Depending on the usage, it might be necessary to install the optional
sagemath packages dot2tex__ (translate dot file to tikz to draw nice graphs),
glucose__ (SAT solver) and latte_int__::

    sage -i dot2tex glucose latte_int

Note that graphviz must be installed *before* dot2tex.

Installation
------------

The module is distributed on PyPI and is easily installed through the Python
package manager pip::

    sage -pip install slabbe

To install the module in your user space (which does not require administrator
rights)::

    sage -pip install slabbe --user

To install the most recent development version::

    sage -pip install --upgrade git+https://gitlab.com/seblabbe/slabbe

Usage::

    sage: from slabbe import *

Other Python packages you may want to install
---------------------------------------------

Some functionalities of ``slabbe`` package depend on the installation of few
Python libraries such as pytimeparse__ (time expression parser) and roman__
(integer to Roman numerals converter)::

    sage -pip install pytimeparse roman

__ https://pypi.org/project/pytimeparse/
__ https://pypi.org/project/roman/

Other System packages you may want to install
---------------------------------------------

Some functionalities of ``slabbe`` package depend on the installation of a
linear program solver such as Gurobi__. See the thematic tutorial to setup the
`installation of Gurobi in SageMath``__.

__ http://www.gurobi.com/
__ http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/linear_programming.html#using-cplex-or-gurobi-through-sage

It builds on SageMath
---------------------

It depends heavily on the SageMath library as it uses the following modules:
combinat, functions, geometry, graphs, matrix, misc, modules, numerical,
parallel, plot, probability, rings, sat, sets, structure, symbolic.

SageMath__ is free open source math software that supports research and
teaching in algebra, geometry, number theory, cryptography, and related areas.  

__ http://www.sagemath.org/

Follows the Best practices for scientific computing
---------------------------------------------------

It follows as much as possible the `SageMath general conventions`__ and the
`Best Practices for Scientific Computing`__. Each module is fully documented
and doctested. Before each new release, we make sure that all examples are
working. As the `ReScience Journal`__ says: "*Reproducible science is good.
Replicated Science is better*".

Future inclusion into Sage
--------------------------

Some modules may have a wider interest to the SageMath community
(``tikz_picture.py`` for example) and could be included in SageMath at some
point. Please contact the author if you want to act as a reviewer for some
module(s) and I will create a ticket on trac__ for its inclusion into SageMath.
