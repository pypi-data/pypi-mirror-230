# parallel-parrot

A Python library for easily and quickly using LLMs on tabular data.  Because synchronous for-loops are too slow, and parallelism can be a pain.

[![pytest](https://github.com/novex-ai/parallel-parrot/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/novex-ai/parallel-parrot/actions/workflows/pytest.yml)
[![Poetry](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://python-poetry.org/badge/v0.json)](https://python-poetry.org/)

Use cases:
- generate questions from documents for better Retrieval Augmented Generation (match questions to questions, not documents)
- sentiment analysis on a large number of documents
- data extraction and summarization
- removal of personal identifiers
- generate instructions from documents for fine tuning of LLMs

Main Features:
- Operates on both pandas dataframes and native python lists of dictionaries
- Supports OpenAI Chat Completion API, with structured output "functions" (more LLMs planned in the future)
- Prepare data for fine-tuning

Other Features:
- Fast asynchronous (concurrent) requests using aiohttp and uvloop
- Python logging support
- Runs a single request first, without retries.  This helps in troubleshooting API access, with a cleaner stacktrace if, for example, the API token is incorrect.
Also, uses that request to pull [rate limit information](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) from the OpenAI API to optimize the parallel requests to run as fast as possible.
- Automatic retries, with exponential backoff, jitter, and header-based delays
- Uses simple/performant Python [string.Template](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.Template) strings for prompt templates.  e.g. `"summarize: ${input}"`
- "Batteries included" with pre-engineered prompt templates
- Tracking of API usage statistics, to support cost controls
- Supports pandas 1.x and 2.x APIs


## Getting Started

```python
pip install parallel-parrot
```

Define an API configuration object:
```python
import parallel_parrot as pp

config = pp.OpenAIChatCompletionConfig(
    openai_api_key="*your API key*"
)
```

see the [declaration](https://github.com/novex-ai/parallel-parrot/blob/v0.1.0/parallel_parrot/types.py#L22) of `OpenAIChatCompletionConfig` for more available parameters, including the `system_message`.
All [Open API parameters](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) can be passed.  Note that only models supported by the [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/gpt-models) can be used with this configuration.

## Generate Text - pp.parallel_text_generation()

LLM text generation can be used for a wide variety of tasks:
- Sentiment analysis: for understanding large amounts of customer input.
- Summarization: for making a large number of documents easier to digest/use.
- Text transformation: such as the removal of PII from text

see the [prompt_templates](https://github.com/novex-ai/parallel-parrot/blob/v0.1.0/parallel_parrot/prompt_templates.py) for some pre-engineered templates.

Example of `pp.parallel_text_generation()`:
```python
import json
import parallel_parrot as pp


input_data = [
    {
        "input": "this is a super duper product that will change the world",
        "source": "shopify",
    },
    {
        "input": "this is a horrible product that does not work",
        "source": "amazon"
    }
]

(output, usage_stats) = pp.sync_run(
    pp.parallel_text_generation(
        config=config,
        input_data=input_data,
        prompt_template="""
What is the sentiment of this product review?
POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE?
product review: ${input}
sentiment:""",
        output_key="sentiment",
    )
)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

example output:
```json
[
    {
        "input": "this is a super duper product that will change the world",
        "source": "shopify",
        "sentiment": "POSITIVE",
    },
    {
        "input": "this is a horrible product that does not work",
        "source": "amazon",
        "sentiment": "NEGATIVE",
    }
]
```

_Note: If your config includes `n` > 1, then multiple LLM outputs per prompt are created.  This package dedupes those outputs, and may then create multiple rows in the output for a given input row_

## Generate Data - pp.parallel_data_generation()

Some use-cases are more demanding than the above, and require multiple structured outputs.  This package handles all of that API and data wrangling for you.

Some examples of these use cases include:
- generating multiple question/answer pairs from each input document
- generating multiple title/summary pairs from each input document

see the [prompt_templates](https://github.com/novex-ai/parallel-parrot/blob/v0.1.0/parallel_parrot/prompt_templates.py) for some pre-engineered templates.

Example of `pp.parallel_data_generation()`:
```python
import json
import parallel_parrot as pp

input_data = [
    {
        "input": """
George Washington (February 22, 1732 - December 14, 1799) was an American military officer, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Second Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted and ratified the Constitution of the United States and established the American federal government. Washington has thus been called the "Father of his Country".
        """
    },
    {
        "input": """
John Adams (October 30, 1735 - July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father who served as the second president of the United States from 1797 to 1801. Before his presidency, he was a leader of the American Revolution that achieved independence from Great Britain. During the latter part of the Revolutionary War and in the early years of the new nation, he served the U.S. government as a senior diplomat in Europe. Adams was the first person to hold the office of vice president of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. He was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with important contemporaries, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams and his friend and political rival Thomas Jefferson.
        """
    },
]

(output, usage_stats) = pp.sync_run(
    pp.parallel_data_generation(
        config=config,
        input_data=input_data,
        prompt_template="""
Generate question and answer pairs from the following document.
Output a list of JSON objects with keys "question" and "answer".
Only output questions and answers clearly described in the document.  If there are no questions and answers, output an empty list.
document: ${input}
        """,
        output_key_names: ["question", "answer"]
    )
)
print(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
```

example output:
```json
[
  {
    "input": "...",
    "question": "Who was the first president of the United States?",
    "answer": "George Washington"
  },
  {
    "input": "...",
    "question": "What position did George Washington hold during the American Revolutionary War?",
    "answer": "Commander of the Continental Army"
  },
  {
    "input": "...",
    "question": "What document did George Washington help draft and ratify?",
    "answer": "The Constitution of the United States"
  },
  // more examples omitted
  {
    "input": "...",
    "question": "Who were some important contemporaries that John Adams corresponded with?",
    "answer": "Adams regularly corresponded with important contemporaries, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams and his friend and political rival Thomas Jefferson."
  },
  {
    "input": "...",
    "question": "Who was John Adams?",
    "answer": "John Adams was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding Father."
  },
]
```

Notice that multiple output rows are created for each input, based on what the LLM returns.  All input columns/keys are retained, to permit integration (joining) with other code.

_Note: Despite the function name, this is not the only way that data can be generated from an LLM.  However, it is powerful enough for many use-cases._

## Prepare Fine-Tuning Data for OpenAI - pp.write_openai_fine_tuning_jsonl()

If you need to do [OpenAI Fine Tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) - but find it a pain to
split your data at appropriate token counts in jsonl format, the `parrallel-parrot` can help with this as well.

```python
import json
import parallel_parrot as pp

input_dictlist = [
  {
    "question": "Who was the first president of the United States?",
    "answer": "George Washington"
  },
  {
    "question": "What position did George Washington hold during the American Revolutionary War?",
    "answer": "Commander of the Continental Army"
  },
  {
    "question": "What document did George Washington help draft and ratify?",
    "answer": "The Constitution of the United States"
  },
]

paths = pp.write_openai_fine_tuning_jsonl(
    input_dictlist=input_dictlist,
    prompt_key="question",
    completion_key="answer",
    system_message="",
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",  # used to calculate token counts
    output_file_prefix="/tmp/parallel_parrot/test_fine_tuning",
)
print(json.dumps(paths, indent=2, default=str))
```

This will create files that can be sent directly to the [OpenAI Fine Tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset).  Doing so with this example will result in an LLM which knows more than the average parrot about presidents of the USA.

example output paths:
```
/tmp/parallel_parrot/test_fine_tuning.00001.jsonl
/tmp/parallel_parrot/test_fine_tuning.00002.jsonl
```
