Getting Started
===============

In order to understand the code in its entirety, 4 tutorials have been created for the user to follow.
These are in order of increasing complexity and each detail the steps required to obtain usable data from the code.
It is reccommended that the user reads through these tutorials in order to get a full understanding of what each function does and how it can be applied to the current data.
If the user requires more information about the function, they should see :ref:`api`.

| Tutorial 1 is for a basic case using no model.
| Tutorial 2 is for the case of a simple model.
| Tutorial 3 demonstrates how the code can be used with real data.
| Tutorial 4 shows how the code can be used with complex data and a complex model.
