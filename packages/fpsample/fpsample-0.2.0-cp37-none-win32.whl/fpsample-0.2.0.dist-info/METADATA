Python efficient farthest point sampling (FPS) library, 100x faster than pure Python implementation.

`fpsample` is coupled with `numpy` and built upon Rust pyo3 bindings.

*Library for GPU is under construction*. Any issues are welcome.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

`numpy>=1.16.0` is required. Install `fpsample` using pip:

```shell
pip install -U fpsample
```

### Build from source

The library is built using [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin). Ensure you have maturin, rust and cargo installed.

Build the library and install using:
```shell
maturin develop --release
```

## Usage

```python
import fpsample
import numpy as np

# Generate random point cloud
pc = np.random.rand(4096, 3)
# sample 1024 points
fps_samples_idx = fpsample.fps_sampling(pc, 1024)

fps_npdu_samples_idx = fpsample.fps_npdu_sampling(pc, 1024)
# or specify the windows size
fps_npdu_samples_idx = fpsample.fps_npdu_sampling(pc, 1024, k=64)

fps_npdu_kdtree_samples_idx = fpsample.fps_npdu_kdtree_sampling(pc, 1024)
# or specify the windows size
fps_npdu_kdtree_samples_idx = fpsample.fps_npdu_kdtree_sampling(pc, 1024, k=64)
```

**NOTE**: NPDU method only gives sub-optimal answers. And it assumes that the points are approximately sorted or have **dimensional locality**. Otherwise, the result may be **worse**. Check the paper for details.

NPDU+KDTree method is more robust than NPDU method. It does not require the dimensional locality. But it is slightly slower than vanilla NPDU method. **It is recommended to use NPDU+KDTree method in general cases**.
