A Python library defining data structures optimized for machine learning pipelines 


## What is it ?
**py4ai-core** is a Python package with modular design that provides powerful abstractions to build data 
ingestion pipelines and run end to end machine learning pipelines. 
The library offers lightweight object-oriented interface to MongoDB as well as Pandas based data structures. 
The aim of the library is to provide extensive support for developing machine learning based applications 
with a focus on practicing clean code and modular design. 

## Features
Some cool features that we are proud to mention are: 

### Logging 
1. configFromFiles: utility function to configure loggers according to configuration files, giving options to capture warnings and to define which logger to use to capture errors.
2. WithLogging: Base class setting up the `logger` property defining a logger named according to the class to be used in descendant classes.

### Configurations
Offers a unified framework to parse and store yaml configuration files: 
1. get_confs_in_path: Retrieve all configuration files from system path, with given extension.
2. merge_confs : merge given configuration files. 
3. BaseConfig : Basic configuration class. This class implements utility methods to retrieve configuration sub-levels and values. An instance of this class can be updated merging other instances of the same class.
4. Some pre-implemented configuration classes for some common use cases like: FileSystemConfig, LoggingConfig, MongoConfig and many more.
