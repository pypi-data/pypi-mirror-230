MOREBS
=======
Is a collection of methods and classes written in Python to aid in data generation. Work restructured from my previous project, DER.

Could be installable by
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Features
=========
- `main.py` file not yet coded.
- some information on the code can be found in the `docs` @ `_build/index.html`. To update the documentation there, do 
    `make html`
after getting sphinx-docs installed. 

Update 11/13/22
===============
- I am expecting to write some further documentation for the code in this project before moving on to writing the main file.

*NOTE* otherwise, all of this code is spaghetti code and then I would have no job as a software developer/engineer. Just kidding!!

Update 2/18/23
==============

Development of this program by me is indefinitely halted. 
My last file `deline.py` demonstrates an algorithm to differentiate between 2+ classes of points, but has several inefficiencies made very evident by 
testing it on large datasets.Enjoy the code library functions provided! 

Update 6/18/23
==============

Add `gen_t.py` for two datasets, `t4.csv` and `t5.csv`, used for tests in project `deline_crypto`.
