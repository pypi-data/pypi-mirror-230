## Mnemosyne is the custodian and the live editor of your LLM's memory

#### This comes with a few consequences:

- the LLM's next answer in your chat window will depend on what you make the LLM *believe* that it answered before 
- thus, you can *time travel* through the history of the chat, change what you have asked about and what was answered to you
- if you are a fan of movies like *Total Recall*,*Memento* or *Inception* you can see how the LLM's view of *reality* is distorted by letting *Mnemosyne* play with its memory

#### Other features that simply manage your chat context:

- if you asked the same question again, the answer will be retrieved from the short term or long term memory at no API cost to you
- when you get close to the token limit, the oldest item in the short term memory is moved to the long-term memory
- when changing the subject of your chat you can spill all the content of the short-term memory into the long-term memory
- if you run an LLM using the same API as OpenAI (e.g., **Vicuna**) listening on a local port, Mnemosyne can also manage your interaction with it
