The goal of this library is to provide access to the EEPROM of an Silabs CP210x
under Linux.

The CP210x is an USB-to-serial chip used in a lot of USB devices (similar to
FTDIs and PL2303). The CP210x has a EEPROM on the chip which can be programmed
via USB. Silabs provides already a library and gui programm to program this
EEPROM, but only for windows.
