        ----------
        get_all : bool
            A default SQL query script will be used if `get_all` is set True. The default SQL query will depend on project id if it is
            set to True. All data belonging to the project id will be extracted.
        get_affines : bool
            Set get_affines to False if you want to include affines in the image extraction. (The default is False)
        project_id : Optional[str]
            The `project_id` must be set in the case where `get_all` is set to True. It is not necessary to set this parameter if the user
            is writing a user-customised SQL qeury.
        limit: Optional[Union[int, str]]
            The `limit` is a LIMIT parameter on the SQL query governing how many rows. The default is NULL which is to fetching all rows.
        include_mask : Optional[bool]
            Use include_mask if to specify whether or not you want corresponding masks to your data. The uses should know that the masks exitst,
            or else the return will be empty. This parameter is needed if and only if the get_all is True.
        format_params : Optional[dict]
            The use can include parameters for the SQL query in the dict `format_params`. This can be very helpful in the case of writing pipelines.
        sql_file_path : Optional[str]
            The `sql_file_path` is expected to be set if the user has written a custom SQL query. A standard filepath will be used in the case where
            the user wants to use the default SQL query.
        bucket_name : Optional[str]
            The standard `bucket_name` for the medical images are already given as default although other specific buckets are likely to be in other
            cases than the very standard one.
        verbose : bool
            The verbose flag will print let you print out your query if it is set to True
        image_extraction : bool
            Specify whether you are extracting images or something else by setting this argument to True or False (default is True)

        two wrappers. You simply specify the name of the table you are writing to and include the data as
        records in a dict. You can decide which bucket to store the blobs in, if you have blobs.

        Example of a dictionary with records
        >>>>

        datetime.datetime(0, 1900, 1): None
        }

        The structure is such that the keys are the records values to insert into a table and
        the values are records blobs that you insert into the object storage. The sorting of the keys
        need to follow the sorting in the table.

        Parameters
        ----------
        records : Dict[Union[str, int, float], Any]
            records is the dictionary containing the records you want to insert into MedQuery. The structure of the dict
            matters so please see the example if you are unsure.
        table_name : str
            table_name is simply the name of the table you are inserting into
        verbose : bool
            set verbose to true if you want to have some additional information about your upload
        meta : Union[Dict[str, str], None]
            The meta data will automatically be filled out if your data is np.ndarray
        bucket_name : str
            the bucke name specifies which bucket in the obejct storage you want to use for your data. (mulitmodal_images is the default)
        ignore_conflict : bool
            set ignore conflict to True if you just want to update the table
