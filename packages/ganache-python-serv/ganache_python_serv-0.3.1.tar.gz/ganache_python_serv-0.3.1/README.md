## Installation
```python
pip install ganache_python_serv
```
You will need to have ganache installed globaly in node.js.
## Features

- Initialize Ganache with custom configurations.
- Start and stop Ganache programmatically.
- Interact with the Ganache environment, including mining blocks and adjusting time.
- Monitor Ganache's output and extract key details.

## Usage

### Initialization

Initialize the `Ganache_Service` with custom configurations:
```python
from ganache_service import Ganache_Service

service = Ganache_Service(**kwargs)
```
See Attributes for the initilization optional values.

### Methods

- `start(mnemonic=None, accounts=None)`: Start Ganache with optional mnemonic and accounts.
- `stop()`: Stop the running Ganache instance.
- `mine_block()`: Mine a single block.
- `mine_blocks(n)`: Mine `n` blocks sequentially.
- `increase_time(seconds)`: Increase time in the Ganache environment by a specified number of seconds.

### Attributes

#### Initialization Attributes

These attributes can be set during the initialization of the `Ganache_Service` class:

- `ganache_path`: Path to the Ganache executable. Default: `'ganache'`
- `ip_address`: IP address for Ganache to bind to. Default: `'127.0.0.1'`
- `port`: Port number for Ganache. Default: `8545`
- `fork_url`: URL for the blockchain to fork from. No default value. 
- `fork_block`: Block number to fork from. No default value. 
- `block_time`: Time (in seconds) between blocks. Default: `999999`
- `gas_price`: Gas price in Wei. Default: `20000000000`
- `gas_limit`: Gas limit in Wei. Default: `6721975`

All initialization attributes have to be specified as keyword arguments. If fork parameters aren't specified ganache will start with a clean state.

#### Ganache Output Attributes

These attributes capture the output and details of the running Ganache instance:

- `process`: The subprocess instance representing the running Ganache process.
- `accounts`: List of available accounts.
- `private_keys`: Corresponding private keys for the accounts.
- `mnemonic`: Mnemonic phrase.
- `base_hd_path`: Base HD path.
- `default_gas_price`: Default gas price.
- `block_gas_limit`: Block gas limit.
- `call_gas_limit`: Call gas limit.
- `network_id`: Network ID.
- `time`: Time of initialization.
- `hardfork`: Current hardfork.
- `chain_id`: Chain ID.
