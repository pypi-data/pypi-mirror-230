Fundus is:

* **A static news crawler.** 
  Fundus lets you crawl online news articles with only a few lines of Python code!

* **An open-source Python package.**
  Fundus is built on the idea of building something together. We welcome your
  contribution to  help Fundus [grow](docs/how_to_contribute.md)!

## Quick Start

To install from pip, simply do:

```
pip install fundus
```

Fundus requires Python 3.8+.


## Example 1: Crawl a bunch of English-language news articles

Let's use Fundus to crawl 2 articles from publishers based in the US.

```python
from fundus import PublisherCollection, Crawler

# initialize the crawler for news publishers based in the US
crawler = Crawler(PublisherCollection.us)

# crawl 2 articles and print
for article in crawler.crawl(max_articles=2):
    print(article)
```

That's already it!

If you run this code, it should print out something like this:

```console
Fundus-Article:
- Title: "Feinstein's Return Not Enough for Confirmation of Controversial New [...]"
- Text:  "Democrats jammed three of President Joe Biden's controversial court nominees
          through committee votes on Thursday thanks to a last-minute [...]"
- URL:    https://freebeacon.com/politics/feinsteins-return-not-enough-for-confirmation-of-controversial-new-hampshire-judicial-nominee/
- From:   FreeBeacon (2023-05-11 18:41)

Fundus-Article:
- Title: "Northwestern student government freezes College Republicans funding over [...]"
- Text:  "Student government at Northwestern University in Illinois "indefinitely" froze
          the funds of the university's chapter of College Republicans [...]"
- URL:    https://www.foxnews.com/us/northwestern-student-government-freezes-college-republicans-funding-poster-critical-lgbtq-community
- From:   FoxNews (2023-05-09 14:37)
```

This printout tells you that you succesfully crawled two articles!

For each article, the printout details:
- the "Title" of the article, i.e. its headline 
- the "Text", i.e. the main article body text
- the "URL" from which it was crawled
- the news source it is "From"


## Example 2: Crawl a specific news source

Maybe you want to crawl a specific news source instead. Let's crawl news articles from Washington Times only:

```python

from fundus import PublisherCollection, Crawler

# initialize the crawler for Washington Times
crawler = Crawler(PublisherCollection.us.WashingtonTimes)

# crawl 5 articles and print
for article in crawler.crawl(max_articles=2):
    print(article)
```
