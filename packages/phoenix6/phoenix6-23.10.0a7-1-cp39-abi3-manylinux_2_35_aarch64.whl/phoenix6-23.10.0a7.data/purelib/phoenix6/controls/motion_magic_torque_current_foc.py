        position using a motion profile.  Users can optionally provide a torque current
        feedforward.

        Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to honor
        the Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk value specified via the Motion
        Magic® configuration values.  Target position can be changed on-the-fly and
        Motion Magic® will do its best to adjust the profile.  This control mode is
        based on torque current, so relevant closed-loop gains will use Amperes for the
        numerator.
