        This feature requires Phoenix Pro and CANivore.

         Requests Motion Magic® to
        target a final position using a motion profile.  This dynamic request allows
        runtime changes to Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk.  Users can
        optionally provide a torque current feedforward.  This control requires use of a
        CANivore.

        Motion Magic® produces a motion profile in real-time while attempting to honor
        the specified Cruise Velocity, Acceleration, and Jerk value.  Target position
        can be changed on-the-fly and Motion Magic® will do its best to adjust the
        profile. This control mode is based on torque current, so relevant closed-loop
        gains will use Amperes for the numerator.
