### Chatbot

Import the `Chatbot` class: In your Python script, import the `Chatbot` class from `llmfast`. You can do this by adding the following line at the beginning of your code:

```python
from llmfast import Chatbot
```

- Obtain an OpenAI API key: To use the `llmfast` library, you'll need an API key from OpenAI. If you don't have one, sign up on the OpenAI website and obtain an API key.

- Create a `Chatbot` instance: Initialize the Chatbot class with your OpenAI API key and specify the desired role for your chatbot. Here's an example of creating a `Chatbot` instance:

- Replace `"YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key, and `"ENTER-YOUR-CHATBOT-ROLE"` with the desired role for your chatbot.

- Deploy the chatbot: Set the `deploy` parameter to `True` when creating the `Chatbot` instance. This will deploy the chatbot and make it available for use.

- To deploy or terminate the deployment of a chatbot created using the `mlfast` library, you can set the `deploy` parameter to `True` or `False` when creating the `Chatbot` instance, respectively.


```python
Chatbot(api_key="YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY",
        role="ENTER-YOUR-CHATBOT-ROLE",
        deploy=True)
