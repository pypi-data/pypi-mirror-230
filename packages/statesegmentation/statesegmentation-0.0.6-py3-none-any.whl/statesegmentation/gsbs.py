class GSBS:
    def __init__(self, kmax: int, x: ndarray, statewise_detection: Optional[bool] = True, finetune: Optional[int] = 1,
                 finetune_order: Optional[bool] = True, y: Optional[ndarray] = None, blocksize: Optional[int] = 50,

        """Given an ROI timeseries, this class uses a greedy search algorithm (GSBS) to segment the timeseries into
        neural states with stable activity patterns. GSBS identifies the timepoints of neural state transitions,
        while t-distance is used to determine the optimal number of neural states.
        You can find more information about the method here:
        Geerligs L., van Gerven M., Güçlü U. (2021) Detecting neural state transitions underlying event segmentation
        Neuroimage. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118085
        The method has since been improved as described here:
        Geerligs L., Gözükara D., Oetringer D., Campbell K., van Gerven M., Güçlü U (2022)
        A partially nested cortical hierarchy of neural states underlies event segmentation in the human brain
        BioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.429165

        Arguments:
            kmax {int} -- the maximal number of neural states that should be estimated in the greedy search. To estimate
                          the optimal number of states, half the number of timepoints is a reasonable choice for kmax.
            x {ndarray} -- a multivoxel ROI timeseries - timepoint by voxels array
        Keyword Arguments:
            statewise_detection {Optional[bool]} -- if True, a 2-D search for optimal boundary locations is performed.
                                                    This allows the algorithm to determine the location of a new state,
                                                    rather than identifying a boundary between two states.
                                                    A restriction to the search is that both boundaries must be placed
                                                    within a single previously existing state. The algorithm will place
                                                    one or two boundaries at each iteration, based on which of these
                                                    options results in the highest t-distance. Therefore, it is possible
                                                    that the algorithm returns kmax+1 states. This improvement in GSBS is
                                                    despribed in more detail in the BioRxiv paper.
                                                    If False, the original GSBS implementation as formulated in the
                                                    Neuroimage paper is used, which adds one boundary per iteration.
                                                    (default: {True})
            finetune {Optional[int]} --    the number of TRs around each state boundary in which the algorithm searches
                                            for the optimal boundary during the finetuning step. If finetune is 0,
                                            no finetuning of state boundaries is performed. If finetune is <0 all TRs
                                            are included during the finetuning step. Note that the latter option will be
                                            computationally intensive. (default: {1})
            finetune_order  {Optional[int]} -- the order in which boundaries are finetuned is determined by the boundary
                                               strength. If True, the finetuning of boundaries is performed in the order
                                               of weakest-strongest boundary. If False, the funetuning is perfomed in the
                                               order of strongest-weakest. (default: {True})
                                               Note that this is different from the original implementation in the
                                               Neuroimage paper where the order of finetuning was based on the order
                                               in which boundaries were detected.
            y {Optional[ndarray]} -- a multivoxel ROI timeseries - timepoint by voxels array
                                      if y is given, the t-distance will be based on cross-validation,
                                      such that the state boundaries are identified using the data in x and the
                                      optimal number of states is identified using the data in y. If y is not given
                                      the state boundaries and optimal number of states are both based on x.
                                      (default: {None})
            blocksize {Optional[int]} -- to speed up the computation when the number of timepoints is large, the algorithm
                                        can first detect local optima for boundary locations within a block of one or
                                        multiple states before obtaining the optimum across all states. Blocksize
                                        indicates the minimal number of timepoints that constitute a block. (default: {50})
            dmin {Optional[int]} -- the number of TRs around the diagonal of the time by time correlation matrix that
                                    are not taken into account in the computation of the t-distance metric. For the
                                    default value of 1, only the diagonal itself is not taken into account (default: {1})
