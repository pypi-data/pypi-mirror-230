A collection of notes that the REDbot can emit.

PLEASE NOTE: the summary field is automatically HTML escaped, so it can contain arbitrary text (as
long as it's unicode).

However, the longer text field IS NOT ESCAPED, and therefore all variables to be interpolated into
it need to be escaped to be safe for use in HTML.
