# Official Authorization
This implementation may be used so long as its usage satisfies the following criteria:

- it does not use/reproduce, in any manner, Decrypto's logo, illustration or visual identity of the game

- it does not use/reproduce, in any manner, Scorpion Masque’s logo

- it states clearly being a "non official" version of the game

- it does not allow to play the full game normally (Humans playing against each others or against AI) so that it does not compete against Scorpion Masque’s versions of the game
