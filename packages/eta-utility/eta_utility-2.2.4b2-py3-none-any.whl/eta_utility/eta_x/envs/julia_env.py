    """Abstract environment definition, providing some basic functionality for concrete environments to use.
    The class implements and adapts functions from gym.Env. It provides additional functionality as required by
    the ETA-X framework and should be used as the starting point for new environments.

    The initialization of this superclass performs many of the necessary tasks, required to specify a concrete
    environment. Read the documentation carefully to understand, how new environments can be developed, building on
    this starting point.

    There are some attributes that must be set and some methods that must be implemented to satisfy the interface. This
    is required to create concrete environments.
    The required attributes are:

        - **version**: Version number of the environment.
        - **description**: Short description string of the environment.
        - **action_space**: The action space of the environment (see also gym.spaces for options).
        - **observation_space**: The observation space of the environment (see also gym.spaces for options).

    The gym interface requires the following methods for the environment to work correctly within the framework.
    Consult the documentation of each method for more detail.

        - **step()**
        - **reset()**
        - **close()**

    :param env_id: Identification for the environment, useful when creating multiple environments.
    :param config_run: Configuration of the optimization run.
    :param seed: Random seed to use for generating random numbers in this environment
        (default: None / create random seed).
    :param verbose: Verbosity to use for logging.
    :param callback: callback which should be called after each episode.
    :param scenario_time_begin: Beginning time of the scenario.
    :param scenario_time_end: Ending time of the scenario.
    :param episode_duration: Duration of the episode in seconds.
    :param sampling_time: Duration of a single time sample / time step in seconds.
    :param kwargs: Other keyword arguments (for subclasses).
