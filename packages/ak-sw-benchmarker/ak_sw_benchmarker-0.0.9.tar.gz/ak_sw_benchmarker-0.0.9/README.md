# AKFruitYield: AK_SW_BENCHMARKER - Azure Kinect Size Estimation & Weight Prediction Benchmarker

AKFruitYield is a modular software that allows orchard data from RGB-D Azure Kinect cameras to be processed for fruit
size and fruit yield estimation. Specifically, two modules have been developed: i) [AK_SW_BENCHMARKER](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_sw_benchmarker/) that makes it possible
to apply different sizing algorithms and allometric yield prediction models to manually labeled color and depth tree
images; and ii) [AK_VIDEO_ANALYSER](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_video_analyser/) that analyses videos on which to automatically detect apples, estimate their size and
predict yield at the plot or per hectare scale using the appropriate simulated algorithms. Both modules have easy-to-use
graphical interfaces and provide reports that can subsequently be used by other analysis tools.

[AK_VIDEO_ANALYSER](https://pypi.org/project/ak-video-analyser/) is part of the [AKFruitData](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101231) and AKFruitYield family (Fig 1.), a suite
that offers field acquisition tools focused on the [Azure Kinect DK sensor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en/azure/kinect-dk/). Table 1-2 shows the links to the other
developed tools.

| AK_ACQS Azure Kinect Acquisition System ([https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_acquisition_system](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_acquisition_system)) | AK_ACQS is a software solution for data acquisition in fruit orchards using a sensor system boarded on a terrestrial vehicle. It allows the coordination of computers and sensors through the sending of remote commands via a GUI. At the same time, it adds an abstraction layer on library stack of each sensor, facilitating its integration. This software solution is supported by a local area network (LAN), which connects computers and sensors from different manufacturers ( cameras of different technologies, GNSS receiver) for in-field fruit yield testing. |

## AK_SW_BENCHMARKER description

Python based GUI tool for fruit size estimation and weight prediction. It receives as input a data set in the format
explained by [Miranda et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101231) and a ground truth file to display
various fruit measurements. ak-sw-benchmarker is part of the AKFruitYield family (Fig 2.), a suite that offers field
acquisition tools focused on the Azure Kinect DK sensor. Table 1 shows the links to the other developed tools. This is
the Github repository of **ak-simulator**, an installable version can be found published on [Pypi.org](https://pypi.org/search/?q=ak_sw_benchmarker) at the following

## Contents

1. Pre-requisites.
2. Functionalities.
3. Install and run.
4. Files and folder description.
5. Development tools, environment, build executables.

## 1. Pre-requisites

* [SDK Azure Kinect](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/kinect-dk/set-up-azure-kinect-dk) installed.
* [pyk4a library](https://pypi.org/project/pyk4a/) installed. If the operating system is Windows, follow
  this [steps](https://github.com/etiennedub/pyk4a/). You can find test basic examples with
  pyk4a [here](https://github.com/etiennedub/pyk4a/tree/master/example).
* In Ubuntu 20.04, we provide a script to install the camera drivers following the instructions
  in [azure_kinect_notes](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_acquisition_system/tree/main/docs/azure_kinect_notes/).
* Videos recorded with the Azure Kinect camera, optional video samples are available at [AK_FRAEX - Azure Kinect Frame Extractor demo videos](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6968103)


## 2. Functionalities

The functionalities of the software are briefly described. Supplementary material can be
found in [USER's Manual](https://github.com/GRAP-UdL-AT/ak_sw_benchmarker/blob/main/docs/USER_MANUAL_ak_sw_benchmarker_v1.md).

* **Analyse dataset** allows benchmarking to be performed with a final report of size estimates and weight prediction. The user has the option of introducing a file with values of real dimensions of fruits (ground truth) to compare with the set of images that it is desired to be analyzed. A final report with results (size and weight) grouped by image and fruit will be presented according to the selected parameters in addition to the test metrics.
* **Export images** makes it possible to visualize the geometric fitting of the ROIs on the objects (fruits) to be measured. Outputs are color images including binary masks of selected objects and fruit labeling. This functionality adds value to the software since the user can observe how sizing algorithms are applied to the images, enabling corrective adjustments in the algorithm configuration if necessary.
* **Run tests in dataset** calculates the test metrics. The user must first indicate the estimate to be analyzed (Report selector in Fig. 2b), namely the major geometric axis of the fruit (A1), the minor axis (A2) or the weight (WEIGHT). Since all sizing-yielding combinations are analyzed, this functionality allows the method with least error to be determined, also obtaining a final ranking of sizing algorithms or ranking of sizing-allometric model combinations.
