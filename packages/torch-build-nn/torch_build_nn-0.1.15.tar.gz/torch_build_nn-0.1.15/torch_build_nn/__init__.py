r"""
The torch package contains data structures for multi-dimensional
tensors and defines mathematical operations over these tensors.
Additionally, it provides many utilities for efficient serialization of
Tensors and arbitrary types, and other useful utilities.

It has a CUDA counterpart, that enables you to run your tensor computations
on an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability >= 3.0.
