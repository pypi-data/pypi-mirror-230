        The constructor of the GA class accepts all parameters required to
        create an instance of the GA class. It validates such parameters.

        Args:
            cost_function: Custom function for the cost calculation (fitness).
            The optimisation
            goal is minimising the output of the cost function.
                cost_function must be the function with one argument - a dictionary of
                values, where the key is an index (the ordinal of adding parameters)
                and the key is the parameter's value to be optimised.

                When adding parameters, there should be as
                many parameters as the function uses. The
                cost_function is the only mandatory parameter.

            population_size: Number of chromosomes in the population.

            exit_check: A criteria for the exit for the genetic algorithm

            requested_cost: This parameter only takes place when exit_check
            has value “requested”. It determines the requested value
            which causes the exit from the genetic algorithm

            max_attempt_no: This parameter only takes place when exit_check
            has value “avg_cost” or “min_cost”. It determines the number of
            generations in which there is no improvement in the average/minimal cost.

            parent_selection: The algorithm for parent selection.

            population_mutation: A type of mutation for the entire population.

                Based on the value of this parameter, the number of mutation
                chromosomes can be determined, along with how
                chromosomes for the mutation will be selected.

            number_of_mutation_chromosomes: The number of
            mutation chromosomes in the population.

                In case it's value is equal to or higher than 0,
                it overrides percentage_of_mutation_chromosomes.

                This value is the upper bound - the actual
                number of mutated chromosomes
                can vary from 1 to number_of_mutation_chromosomes.

            percentage_of_mutation_chromosomes: The percentage of mutated chromosomes
            in the population.
                This value is applied to the population_size value and rounded to an
                integer value, giving the number of mutation chromosomes.

                For example, if population_size has a value of 32,
                and percentage_of_mutation_chromosomes has a value of
                10, the number of mutation chromosomes will be 3.

                The calculated value is an upper bound - the actual
                number of mutated chromosomes can vary from 1 to the calculated value.

                percentage_of_mutation_chromosomes only applies if
                number_of_mutation_chromosomes does not have a valid
                integer value equal to or higher than 0.

            parent_diversity_mutation_chromosome_selection: The
            selection algorithm for mutating chromosomes when population_mutation
            contains value “parent_diversity”.
                It only applies when population_mutation has value
                “parent_diversity”. It determines the way how chromosomes are to
                be selected based on the diversity of their parents.

            must_mutate_for_same_parents: Indicates if completely the same
            parents must influence mutation for their children.
                In other words, each child will be mutated if it has
                parents with a diversity value of 0.

                If must_mutate_for_same_parents has the value True, the
                number of mutated chromosomes can outreach value
                determined by number_of_mutation_chromosomes or
                percentage_of_mutation_chromosomes

            chromosome_mutation: The type of mutation of genes in chromosomes.

            number_of_mutation_genes: The number of mutated genes in each chromosome.
                In case it's value is equal to or higher than 0, it overrides
                percentage_of_mutation_genes.

                This value is the upper bound - the number of mutated genes
                can vary from 1 to number_of_mutation_genes.

            percentage_of_mutation_genes: The percentage of
            mutated genes in each chromosome.
                It applies to the chromosome size
                (number of genes in each chromosome), and
                the calculated value rounds to an integer value.

                The calculated value is the upper bound - the actual number of
                mutated genes can vary from 1 to the calculated value.

                percentage_of_mutation_genes only applies if
                number_of_mutations_genes does not have a valid
                integer value equal to or higher than 0.

            cross_diversity_mutation_gene_selection: The selection algorithm for
            mutating chromosomes when chromosome_mutation has value “cross_diversity”.
                It only applies when chromosome_mutation has value
                “cross_diversity” . It determines the way how genes
                are to be selected based on the cross-diversity.

            immigration_number: Refers to the “Random Immigrants”
            concepts. This strategy introduces a certain number of
            individuals into the population during the evolution process.
                These new individuals are generated randomly
                and injected into the population.

            logging: If this parameter has a True value, the log file
            will be created in the current working directory.
            The log file contains the flow of genetic algorithm execution,
            along with values of chromosomes, genes and cost
            functions in each generation

            timeout: A number of seconds after which the genetic algorithm
            optimisation will exit, regardless of whether
            exit_check criteria is reached.

        “cost_diversity” determines the number of mutated chromosomes adaptively,
        using the diversity of costs in the population. Lower cost diversity
        means a higher number of mutated chromosomes. The minimal value of
        mutated chromosomes is 0, and the maximal value is determined by
        the value of number_of_mutation_chromosomes or
        percentage_of_mutation_chromosomes
        parameters. If population_mutation has a value other than
        “cost_diversity”, the number of mutation chromosomes is a
        random value from 1 to number_of_mutation_chromosomes
        value (or to value determined by percentage_of_mutation_chromosomes value).
        “cost_diversity” means that the “parent_diversity” method is selected
        to select chromosomes to be mutated. This method only determines
        the number of mutated chromosomes, but not how
        chromosomes are selected for the mutation.

        **"parent_diversity"** - It applies to the way how mutation
        chromosomes will be selected. “parent_diversity” selects
        chromosomes to be mutated using the diversity of their parents.
        The more similar parents (lower parent diversity) mean a higher
        probability of mutation for the child. Based on the calculated
        parent diversity, chromosomes may be selected by one of the
        selection methods, which is determined by the value of the
        parent_diversity_mutation_chromosome_selection parameter.

        **"random"** - It applies to the number of mutation chromosomes
        and to the way how mutation chromosomes will be selected. “random”
        selects chromosomes to be mutated randomly, and randomly

        assigned to the chromosomes to be mutated are proportional
        to the similarity of their parents (inversely proportional
        to the parent diversity). A chromosome with the lowest
        parent diversity has the greatest probability of
        mutation, while the chromosome with the highest
        parent diversity has the lowest probability of mutation.

        **"tournament"** - The Tournament selection algorithm.
        It randomly picks small subsets (groups) of chromosomes,
        and chromosomes with the lowest parent diversity (highest parent similarity)
        in subsets are chosen to be mutated. “tournament” can have an additional
        parameter separated from the “tournament” keyword by the comma.
        The other value represents a group size. For example, “tournament,8” means
        that the tournament mutation selection algorithm is chosen, and
        each group contains up to 8 members. The default group size is 4.

        **"from_top_to_bottom"** - From Top To Bottom selection
        algorithm starts at the top of the list and
        selects chromosomes for mutation.

        **"random"** - Random selection algorithm uses a
        uniform random number generator to select

        It only applies when chromosome_mutation has value “cross_diversity” .
        It determines the way how genes are to be selected based on the cross-diversity.

        Supported values:

        **"roulette_wheel"** - The Roulette Wheel selection algorithm
        (also known as “Weighted Random Pairing”). The probabilities
        assigned to the genes to be mutated are inversely
        proportional to their cross-diversity. A gene
        with the lowest cross-diversity has the greatest
        probability of mutation, while the gene with the
        highest cross-diversity has the lowest
        probability of mutation.

        **"tournament"** - The Tournament selection algorithm. It randomly picks
        small subsets (groups) of genes, and genes with the lowest cross-diversity
        in subsets are chosen to be mutated. “tournament” can have
        an additional parameter separated from the “tournament”
        keyword by the comma. The other value represents a group size.
        For example, “tournament,3” means that the tournament
        mutation selection algorithm is chosen, and each group
        contains up to 3 members. The default group size is 4.

        **"from_top_to_bottom"** - From Top To Bottom selection
        algorithm starts at the top of the list and selects genes for mutation.

        **"random"** - Random selection algorithm uses a
        uniform random number generator to select genes for mutation.
        In this case, selection for the mutation will not
        depend on gene cross-diversity.

        Supported values:

        **"roulette_wheel"** - Roulette Wheel selection algorithm
        (also known as “Weighted Random Pairing”).
        The probabilities assigned to the chromosomes in the mating pool are
        inversely proportional to their cost. A chromosome with the lowest
        cost has the greatest probability of mating, while the chromosome
        with the highest cost has the lowest probability of mating.

        **"tournament"** - Tournament selection algorithm. It randomly picks small
        subsets (groups) of chromosomes from the mating pool, and chromosomes
        with the lowest cost in subsets become a parent. “tournament”
        can have an additional parameter separated from the “tournament”
        keyword by the comma. The other value represents a group size.
        For example, “tournament,8” means that the tournament
        parent selection algorithm is chosen, and
        each group contains up to 8 members.
        The default group size is 4.

        **"from_top_to_bottom"** - From Top To Bottom selection
        algorithm starts at the top of

        are selected for mating. Thus, the algorithm pairs odd rows with even rows.

        **"random"** - Random selection algorithm uses a uniform random
