# IMMUTABLES

A series of immutable types for use in python projects.

## Immutable Types and why they matter

**ImmutableList** - The ImmutableList type is a python type that allows you to instantiate a list once and then use the contents of that list. As this list is immutable, it can not be modified in any way.

**Set** - the Set type in python is mutable. Python's built in frozenset is the immutable version of the **Set** type. No additional types are needed.

**Dict** - the Dictionary type in python is mutable. Pythons built in namedtuple type is the immutable version of the **dict** type. No additional types are needed.
