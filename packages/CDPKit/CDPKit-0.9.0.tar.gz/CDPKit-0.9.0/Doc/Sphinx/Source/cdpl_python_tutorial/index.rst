CDPL Python Tutorial
===========================
.. note::
   Please install CDPKit before proceeding with the tutorial. For installation instructions, please refer to the `CDPKit installation documentation <https://cdpkit.org/master/installation.html>`_.
   There is also a a powerful search tool on the top right corner of the page that you can use to find particular functions or modules within the documentation.

Welcome to the "Getting Started with CDPKit using Python" tutorial! If you're familiar with cheminformatics 
libraries like RDKit, you'll find that CDPKit offers a unique set of tools and functionalities that can take your 
computational drug design projects to new heights.

CDPKit, or *Chemical Data Processing Toolkit*, is a powerful open-source library crafted for advanced drug discovery applications. 
Whether you're a researcher, a student, or an industry professional, this tutorial aims to introduce the basic concepts and 
functionalities of CDPKit, enabling you to harness its full potential.

In the subsequent sections, we'll walk you through the foundational concepts and dive into practical applications with hands-on examples.
By the end, you'll be well-equipped to incorporate CDPKit into your workflow and start crafting effective drug design solutions using Python.

.. note::
   For a detailed description of the available functionality, just go to the `CDPKit Python API Documentation <https://cdpkit.org/master/python_api_doc/index.html>`_
   and search for the desired method or class. There you will find an exact description of the method, its parameters and return values.

So, grab a coffee (or tea) and let's embark on this exciting journey into the realm of computational drug design with CDPKit!
