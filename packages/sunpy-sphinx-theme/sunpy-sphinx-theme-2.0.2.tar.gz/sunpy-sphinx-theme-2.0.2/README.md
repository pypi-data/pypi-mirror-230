# SunPy Sphinx Theme

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sunpy-sphinx-theme.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sunpy-sphinx-theme)

This repository contains the sphinx theme used by the Sunpy Project for its website and documentation.

This theme is a derivitive of the excellent [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), customised to present a uniform navigation over all the sunpy projects.

For more information see the [documentation](https://sunpy-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/).
