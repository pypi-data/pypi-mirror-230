Hi there, Developer! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited to have you on board. dotagent is a library of modular components and an orchestration framework. Inspired by a microservices approach, it gives developers all the components they need to build robust, stable & reliable AI applications and experimental autonomous agents.


## Welcome screen
