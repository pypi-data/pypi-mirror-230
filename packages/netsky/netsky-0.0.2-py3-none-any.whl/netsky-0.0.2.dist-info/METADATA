# netsky

not skynet, obviously

## getting started

`pip install netsky`

Create the `~/.netsky/.env` file. If you're reading this, you probably work at VoDa -- ask internally.

### verify installation

`netsky` should now be installed as a CLI tool:

```python
(venv) cody@dkdcsot netsky % netsky

 Usage: netsky [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

╭─ Options ─────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ --version                     Show version.               │
│ --install-completion          Install completion for the  │
│                               current shell.              │
│ --show-completion             Show completion for the     │
│                               current shell, to copy it   │
│                               or customize the            │
│                               installation.               │
│ --help                        Show this message and exit. │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
╭─ Commands ────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ai                            ai                          │
│ test                          test                        │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Confirm commands work:

```python
(venv) cody@dkdcsot netsky % netsky test
testing.ai: done...
```

And invoke advanced ai commands:

```python
(venv) cody@dkdcsot netsky % netsky ai
netsky.ai:
access to: netsky.ai
```

## examples

To get started for real, run `netsky ai -i`. You will have an interactive Python session with access to the netsky.ai `bot` object. Interact with it!

```python
[ins] In [1]: bot("who are you?")
netsky.ai: I am netsky.ai, your digital assistant designed to assist you
with a wide variety of tasks. I was created by dkdc.dev and
I've been designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, always
ready to help you achieve your goals. Is there something
specific you need assistance with?
```

### open in browser

You can casually ask the bot to open links in your browser:

```python
[ins] In [2]: bot("can you open that dkdc.dev website in my b
         ...: rowser?")
netsky.ai: Sure, I have opened the dkdc.dev website in your browser.
Please let me know if you need assistance with anything else.
```

### internet search

While the bot is programmed to know its creator (`dkdc.dev`), it's not programmed to know anything about me -- it has to search the web for that!

```python
[ins] In [3]: bot("what is dkdc.dev?")
netsky.ai: dkdc.dev is a personal website created by a person named
Cody. It functions as a platform for him to practice writing,
coding, and documenting projects. He has worked as a
Technical Product Manager at Voltron Data focusing on data
interfaces and open-source software like Ibis. Previously, he
was a Product Manager at dbt Labs and Azure ML (Microsoft).
His work mainly revolves around data, MLOps, and developer
platforms.
```

### text summarization

The bot can summarize text:

```python
[ins] In [4]: bot("can you find some recent posts from the si
         ...: te?")
netsky.ai: Here are some recent posts from dkdc.dev:

1. [About](https://dkdc.dev/about/): A page dedicated to the
creator of the site, Cody. He discusses his passion for
progress through technology and his current and previous
roles.

2. [How I Built This
Website](https://dkdc.dev/project/website/): This page
provides insight into the process and tools used to build the
dkdc.dev website.

3. [Is Small Data
Dead?](https://dkdc.dev/posts/is-small-data-dead/index.python):
This blog post discusses the shift in the field of machine
learning and data science from small to big data.

Is there any specific post you want to know more about?

[ins] In [5]: bot("can you summarize that third article for m
         ...: e? list out the key points in bullet format. al
         ...: so, open it in the browser first so I can take
         ...: a look")
netsky.ai: I have opened the blog post titled 'Is Small Data Dead?' in
your browser. Here are the key points from the article:

- The blog discusses the shift from small to big data in
machine learning and data science.
- The writer questions the relevance of small data in the
current landscape.
- The post highlights the challenges and opportunities
brought about by this shift.
- The change is reshaping our understanding and use of data.

You can read it in detail
(https://dkdc.dev/posts/is-small-data-dead/index.python).
```

**Author's note: the search engine (duck duck go's free whatever) is pretty bad; the second article it picked up is from my old site. This is a pretty weak link in the current implementation, but could easily be upgraded.

### filesystem access

```python
[ins] In [6]: bot("what's in the current directory?")
netsky.ai: Here are the files in the current directory:

- LICENSE
- justfile
- dev-requirements.txt
- pyproject.toml
- readme.md
- src/netsky/ai.py
- src/netsky/__init__.py
- src/netsky/cli.py
- src/netsky/testing.py
- src/netsky/__main__.py

What would you like to do next?

[ins] In [9]: bot("can you modify it to use the full name 'Co

netsky.ai: Before I proceed with this action, I just want to confirm
that you want me to modify the text of the license file to
replace 'Cody' with 'Cody Peterson'. Is that correct?

[ins] In [10]: bot("yes")
netsky.ai: I have updated the license file. It now reads 'Cody Peterson'
instead of 'Cody'. Is there anything else I can assist you
with?

### database exploration with Ibis

**work in progress**: working decently but needs some refactor

### visualization with plotly

**work in progress**: has not worked decently yet but should be doable

### GitHub search

implemented in a Marvin example, need to replicate or replace

### ...and more!

coming when the `netsky` can write its own code!
