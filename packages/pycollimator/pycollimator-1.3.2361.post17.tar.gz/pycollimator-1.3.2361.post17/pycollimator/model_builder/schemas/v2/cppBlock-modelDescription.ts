/**
Hand-written typescript definition of the cppblock-modelDescription schema.
Examples can be found in

    src/lib/cml/tests/blocks/CppFunction/*-modelDescription.json

If needed, a json schema can be generated from this file with:

    typescript-json-schema \
      cppblock-modelDescription.ts fmiModelDescription \
      > cppblock-modelDescription.schema.json

This is very similar to the FMI modeldescription schema. Changes:

- One modelDescription contains a list of definitions instead of a single
  definition. Each entry has a name and a version, both arbtirary strings.

- Variables have standard tag fields for their type, e.g. `"type: "float32"`
  instead of `"Real": {}`

- The set of types different: float32, float64, int32, etc. instead of Real,
  Integer. The set describes here matches the FMI 3.0 spec.

- Variables have optional dimensions.
