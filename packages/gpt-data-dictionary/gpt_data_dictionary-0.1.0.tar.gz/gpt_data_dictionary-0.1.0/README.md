## What is a Data Dictionary?

A data dictionary is a centralized resource that offers metadata about data elements within a system or project. It outlines key details such as data types, constraints, and definitions, thus facilitating data interpretation and quality assurance. Essentially, a data dictionary is your go-to guide for understanding and managing your data landscape.

## Features

- **Automated Metadata Extraction**: Quickly generate metadata for each column in your dataset, including data types, allowed values, and more.
- **Readable Variable Names**: Utilizes GPT-3.5 to automatically generate human-readable variable names.
- **Quality Indicators**: Provides metadata that can be useful for data quality checks.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to include more advanced statistics or custom metadata as required.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you've installed all required Python packages.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
  
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the main Python script and provide the path to your CSV file.
    ```bash
    poetry run scripts/extract_gpt_data_dictionary.py --csv-file=/path/to/your/csv/file.csv
    ```

3. **Review and Edit**: The generated data dictionary will be saved as a CSV file. Open it to manually enter any domain-specific information that couldn't be automatically generated.

4. **Finalize**: Save your changes to the data dictionary CSV. You can now use this as a comprehensive guide for data understanding and manipulation.

## Example

Running this script for the all famous titanic dataset on Kaggle:

    ```bash
    poetry run scripts/extract_gpt_data_dictionary.py --csv-file=data/titanic_train.csv
    ```

And it will output `gpt_data_dictionary.csv`
