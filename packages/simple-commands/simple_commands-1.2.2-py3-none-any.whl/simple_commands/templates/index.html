            The simple_commands library is a Python library designed to help reduce the time required to write code.
            With a collection of commands, this library is ideal for Python developers.
            who want to increase work efficiency and reduce time spent writing repetitive code
           
            simple_commands library It contains many commands such as
           
                Commands for managing files and folders.
                Command for taking pictures
                Command for creating an image with an existing image.
                Instructions for retrieving time by country
                instructions for math
                Commands for other general tasks
                This library is easy to use. Just import the library and run the required commands. The library will execute that command immediately.
            
            How to use and commands are as follows:
   
            Fetch the library:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import simple_commands
                </code>
                When you import simple_commands, you normally have to write module_name.function_name to use functions from the module. However
                if you use from simple_commands import function, you can use the functions directly without specifying the module name.
            </pre>

                        create_log(name, type="txt"): This function is used to create a new log file. It uses the 'x' mode, which creates a new file only if the file doesn't already exist. If the function is called and the file exists, it returns None without creating a new file.

                        adddata_to_log(name, text, type="txt"): This function is used to append data to a log file. It opens the file in 'a' mode to write data at the end of the log file.

                        delete_log(name, type="txt"): This function is used to delete a log file. It moves the deleted file to the deletedata folder and records information about the deletion in an SQLite database.

                        recover_log(name, type="txt"): This function is used to recover a deleted log file. It checks the time when the file was deleted and, if the deletion occurred less than 30 days ago, it either retrieves the file from the deletedata folder or moves it back to the savedata folder.

                        list_log(name=None, type="txt"): This function is used to list the log files in the savedata folder or in a folder specified by name (if provided) and returns a list of those files.

                        list_log_delete(name, type="txt"): This function is used to list the log files in the deletedata folder or in a folder specified by name (if provided) and returns a list of those files.

                        return_data_log(name, type="txt"): This function is used to read data from a log file and returns the data as a string.

                        delete_text_in_log(name, text_to_delete, type="txt"): This function is used to delete specific text within a log file. It reads all data from the log file, searches and removes the text specified by the user, and then writes the modified data back to the log file, excluding the deleted text.

                        delete_alltext_log(name, type="txt"): This function is used to delete all text content within a log file. It overwrites the log file with an empty file, effectively clearing all its contents.
