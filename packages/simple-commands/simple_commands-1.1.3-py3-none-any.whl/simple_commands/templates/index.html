            The simple_commands library is a Python library designed to help reduce the time required to write code.
            With a collection of commands, this library is ideal for Python developers.
            who want to increase work efficiency and reduce time spent writing repetitive code
           
            simple_commands library It contains many commands such as
           
                Commands for managing files and folders.
                Command for taking pictures
                Command for creating an image with an existing image.
                Instructions for retrieving time by country
                instructions for math
                Commands for other general tasks
                This library is easy to use. Just import the library and run the required commands. The library will execute that command immediately.
            
            How to use and commands are as follows:
   
            Fetch the library:
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import simple_commands
                </code>
                When you import simple_commands, you normally have to write module_name.function_name to use functions from the module. However
                if you use from simple_commands import function, you can use the functions directly without specifying the module name.
            </pre>

                        delete_text_in_log(name, text_to_delete, type="txt"): This function is used to delete specific text within a log file. It reads all data from the log file, searches and removes the text specified by the user, and then writes the modified data back to the log file, excluding the deleted text.

                        delete_alltext_log(name, type="txt"): This function is used to delete all text content within a log file. It overwrites the log file with an empty file, effectively clearing all its contents.
