# statwrap

This is a package meant for intro stats students who are also new to Python, or at least its statistical libraries.

Different submodules adopt different conventions. The `fpp` submodule corresponds to *Statistics* by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves. The `sheets` modules corresponds to Google Sheets.
