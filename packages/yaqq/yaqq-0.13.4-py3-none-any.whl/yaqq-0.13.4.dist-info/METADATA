YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer - Design Space Exploration of Quantum Gate Sets using Novelty Search

The YAQQ (Yaqq Another Quantum Quantizer) is an agent that searches for novel quantum gate sets. Given a gate set, it can find a complementary gate that performs better for a particular set of unitary transformations than the original gate set. It is possible theoretically because (a) there are an infinite number of ways of creating universal quantum computing gate sets - the ubiquity of quantum universality, (b) for each discrete gate set, there are certain quantum states that are easy to express, but many other quantum states which are exponentially costly - universal distribution for quantum automata. The cost, or the performance of a gate set, considers the fidelity when the gate set is used to decompose the target set of quantum transformations and the circuit complexity of the decomposition.
