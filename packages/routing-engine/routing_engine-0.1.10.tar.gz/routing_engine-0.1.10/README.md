Routing engine:
1. Leveraging Polymorphism for Flexibility
2. Functional Programming with Higher-Order Functions
3. Using a Schema to Validate JSON Rules



* 		Logging and Debugging: Implementing a robust logging mechanism can help you quickly identify issues and understand the flow of your rule engine. You might consider using a popular logging library like logging in Python.
* 		Performance Optimization: Depending on the complexity and number of rules, performance can become a concern. Consider optimizing the evaluation of rules through techniques like caching, lazy evaluation, or parallel processing if necessary.
* 		Extensibility: Design your system in a modular way, so new types of conditions, operations, or actions can be easily added in the future.
* 		Validation and Testing: You might want to expand the validation step not only to validate the JSON schema but also to check the logical consistency of the rules. Comprehensive unit testing and integration testing will ensure the system behaves as expected.
* 		User-Friendly Configuration: If this system is going to be used by non-developers, consider creating a user interface (UI) or domain-specific language (DSL) to allow users to create and modify rules without having to edit raw JSON.
* 		Error Handling and Reporting: Building upon the existing error handling, you might want to consider adding user-friendly error messages and mechanisms to handle and report errors at various levels, both for developers and end-users.
* 		Documentation: Ensure that the system is well-documented, especially if it's going to be used by others. Explain the structure of the rules, how to add new actions, and what each part of the system does.
* 		Security Considerations: If this system is going to be exposed to untrusted inputs, take care to sanitize and validate inputs to prevent potential security issues such as code injection.
* 		Monitoring and Analytics: Implementing monitoring and analytics can provide insights into how the rules are being used and the performance of the system. This can be valuable for tuning performance and understanding usage patterns.
* 		Internationalization (I18n) and Localization (L10n): If applicable, consider designing the system to support multiple languages and regional differences, especially in the context of messages, actions, or greetings.
* 		Versioning: If the rule schema might change over time, consider implementing versioning for the rules, so that older rules can still be interpreted correctly by the system.
* 		Interactive Testing/Debugging Tool: A tool that allows users to test individual rules or sets of rules against sample data could be invaluable for debugging and development.
* 		Compliance and Ethical Considerations: Depending on the domain and use case, there might be legal and ethical considerations regarding the decision-making process that the rules encapsulate. Ensuring compliance with relevant laws and ethical guidelines is vital.
Remember, these are general recommendations. The priority and applicability of each might vary depending on the specific requirements, constraints, and context of your project.



changelog:


pip install twine


python3 setup.py sdist


twine upload dist/*


context in kwargs is a aspecila case and the name is reserved when passing arguments and kwargs


do doc for the project , specially in python doc for return values and arguments


the postgres table need to have a column called "rules" which the rules json is in

to get a simulation from the server use the following command:

send the context as json in the body of the POST request
