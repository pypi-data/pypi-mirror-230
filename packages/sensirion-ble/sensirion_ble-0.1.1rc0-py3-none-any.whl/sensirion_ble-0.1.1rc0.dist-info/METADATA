# sensirion-ble

Parser for Sensirion BLE devices.

## Supported devices

* [MyCO2 (aka SCD4x CO2 Gadget)](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SCD4x-CO2-Gadget/)

## Untested devices

* SHT3x based gadgets
* SHT4x based gadgets

Other devices could be supported at a later time, but I don't have any at hand.

## Reference

The parser is based on the [Sensirion Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Specification][sble] (also available in the `reference` folder).
