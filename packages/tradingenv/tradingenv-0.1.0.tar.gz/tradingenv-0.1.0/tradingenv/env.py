        Parameters
        ----------
        action_space
            An instance of PortfolioDiscrete or PortfolioContinuous,
            characterizing the domain of the action observation_space (target weights of
            the portfolio with eventual constraints) and contracts to be traded.
            An equivalent way to use BoxPortfolio consists in providing
            a sequence of contract _names.
        state : State
            A State instance or a list of Features.
        reward : Union[AbstractReward, str]
            The reward function, evaluated at every step. This could either
            be a custom reward (AbstractReward interface implementation) or
            the id of an existing reward (e.g. 'PnL'). For the full list
            of supported rewards see trading_env.rewards.
        transmitter : Transmitter
            Object taking care of delivering events during the interaction
            with the environment (e.g. market prices).
        prices : pd.DataFrame
            A pandas.DataFrame whose columns are asset _names, index are
            timestamps and values are prices. This optional argument allows
            you to avoid specifying a transmitter.
        broker_fees: IBrokerFees
            Instance AbstractBrokerFees with custom initialization or implement
            your own AbstractBrokerFees to set transaction costs.
        sampling_span: int
            This argument is used only if episode_length is passed in
            TrandingEnv.reset. If specified, the episode start date is sampled
            using an exponentially decaying probability. sampling_span is the
            number of recent timesteps that captures ~70% of the likelihood of
            sampling a start date from such window. Uniform distribution is
            used by default if this parameter is not provided. It's useful to
            specify a value if you wish to train RL agents to overweight
            observations in the more recent past.

        seed : int

            generator(s) if `seed` is an integer or if the environment has not
            yet initialized a random number generator. If the environment already

            the RNG should not be reset.
            Moreover, `reset` should (in the typical use case) be called with an
            integer seed right after initialization and then never again.
