#  Pfeature
#  Introduction
Pfeature is developed for computing wide range of protein and peptides features from their amino acid sequences. More information on Pfeature is available from its web server https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pfeature. This page provide information about standalone version of Pfeature. This standalone contains three scripts, their description is as follows:

#############################################################################################################################################################################################################################

1: Standalone for calculating composition based features:

**Important: To run this script 'Data' folder should be in the same directory.**

Minimum USAGE: Minimum ussage is "pfeature_comp -i protein.fa" where protein.fa is a input fasta file. This will calculate the amino acid composition of the seqeunces provided in the fasta file. It will use other parameters by default. It will save output in "pfeature_result.csv" in CSV (comma seperated variables).

#Parameters Description:

		ii) Simple Format, in this case, file should have sequences in a single line in single letter code (eg. protein.seq).

Output File: Program will save result in CSV format, in the provided filename.
		In case user do not provide output file name, it will be stored in pfeature_results.csv.
		In case user want to calculate all the features except AAI and ACR, the job name will be 'ALLCOMP'. Reason to leave AAI and ACR is, the feature calculation takes long time for longer sequences.

Job name: It allows users to choose the type of composition, the user want to calculate, such as AAC which stands for Amino Acid composition.
		In case user do not provide any job name, it will choose AAC by default.

N-terminal: It allows user to cut the specific number of residues from the N-terminal of the sequences.
		

C-terminal: It allows user to cut the specific number of residues from the C-terminal of the sequences.

NCT-terminal: It allows user to cut the specific number of residues from the N- and C-terminal of the sequences, and join them.

Rest_N : It allow users to drop the specific number of residues from N-terminal, and perform operations on the rest.

Rest_C : It allow users to drop the specific number of residues from C-terminal, and perform operations on the rest.

Split: It allow users to divided the sequence into number of sequences.

Lag : It defines the value for order of lag, lambda, gap or dipeptide, to calculate certain features.

Weight: It defines the weight factor to calculate the quasi-sequence order, by default it is set at 0.1.

Pweight: It defines the weight factor to calculate the pseudo and amphiphlic pseudo amino acid composition, by default it is set at 0.05.
