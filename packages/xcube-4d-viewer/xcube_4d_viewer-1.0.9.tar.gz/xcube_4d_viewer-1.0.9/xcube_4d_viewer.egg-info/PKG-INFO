# xcube_4d_viewer
This repository is a plugin for the xcube server.

xcube (https://xcube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) is a Python package for generating and exploiting data
cubes powered by xarray, dask, and zarr. It also provides a web API and server which can be used to access and
visualise these data cubes.

This repository serves as an API extension to the xcube server, allowing xcube data cubes to be analysed and
visualised within Earthwave's 4D viewer. It computes configuration details and
heatmap/3D heatmap/terrain tiles from the server's data cubes and provides them in a format expected by the 4D viewer.

In order to connect to Earthwave's 4D viewer, the API extension needs to know the address of Earthwave's Middle Tier
service, and the xcube server using the extension needs to be externally accessible. Therefore, to make use of the API,
two additional keys must be set in the server config file:
* ServerExternalURL - the externally accessible URL of the xcube server. This should be set up by the user
through a tool such as nginx.
* MiddleTierURL - the current URL of the Middle Tier service. Please contact support@earthwave.co.uk for this
information.

This work is done as part of the DeepESDL project (https://deepesdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
