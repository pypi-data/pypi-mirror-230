This repository contains material and examples relating to the G-Adopt Platform, a computational platform for inverse geodynamics, being developed and maintained by researchers from the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University. It builds on a recent surge in accessible observational datasets and advances in inversion methods using sophisticated adjoint techniques that provide a mechanism for fusing these observations with dynamics, physics and chemistry.

G-ADOPT is supported and funded by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC), with additional partner contributions from AuScope, the NCI and Geosciences Australia.

At this stage, the repository contains material associated with Davies et al. 2021 -- Geoscientific Model Development -- "Automating Finite Element Methods for Geodynamics via Firedrake". The examples and test cases presented in this paper can be found in the Davies_etal_GMD_2021 directory.

Additional material will be added as the project develops.
