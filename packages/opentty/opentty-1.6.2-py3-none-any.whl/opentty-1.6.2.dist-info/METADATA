functions into OpenTTY and turn the users experience more  
cool and funny. If you found an issue, please report and

## Release Notes  

1. OpenTTY Free Runtime

This is the focus of this release, now is possible run PSH  
syntax in app call with `python -m opentty [command]`.  
 
It can run assets, open servers, etc. Only the Background  
Daemon isn't works 'cause it run while OpenTTY is running,  
meaning that with this Runtime it will execute normally.  

Other daemon that doesn't works is The PIPES Plugin, 'cause  
it saves the data in current cache session, what don't happens  
'cause it's call only and closes.  

2. Added assets `enchant` and `openpad`  
3. New HASH Security service in *Permission Plugin*
