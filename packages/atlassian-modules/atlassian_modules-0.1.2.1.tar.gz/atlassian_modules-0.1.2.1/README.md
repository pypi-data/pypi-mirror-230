## Connectivity to Atlassian Jira

To initialize a connection to Jira, instantiate the `JiraHelper` class with your Jira URL, email, and API token:

```python
jira_helper = JiraHelper(JIRA_URL, EMAIL, API_TOKEN)
```

## 1. Create a Jira Ticket

- You can create a new Jira ticket using the `create_ticket` method:

```python
jira_helper.create_ticket("XX", "Test Issue", "This is a test issue created from main.py", "Task")
```

Parameters:
- `project_key`: The key of the project in which the ticket should be created.
- `summary`: A brief summary of the issue.
- `description`: A detailed description of the issue.
- `issue_type`: The type of the issue (e.g., "Task", "Bug", etc.).

## 2. Delete a Jira Ticket

- To delete a ticket, use the `delete_ticket` method:

```python
jira_helper.delete_ticket("XX-1234")
```

Parameter:
- `ticket_key`: The unique key of the ticket you want to delete.

## 3. Transition a Jira Ticket

- To transition a ticket to a different status, use the `transition_ticket` method:

```python
jira_helper.transition_ticket("XX-1234", "In Progress")
# or
jira_helper.transition_ticket("XX-1234", 31)
```

Parameters:
- `ticket_key`: The unique key of the ticket you want to transition.

```python
jira_helper.if_exist_ticket("XX-1234")
```

Parameters:
- `ticket_key`: The unique key of the ticket you want to check that exist.
