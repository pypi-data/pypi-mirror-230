# `clicr`, the CLI Creator

`clicr` (pronounced as *clicker*) is the CLI Creator that aims to be 
the template used to make effective CLI apps using Python.

## Getting Started (Development)

Install [Poetry][poetry]:

[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Create new environment, or use existing environment:

```bash
# Change your python version accordingly (>=3.8)
conda create -n clicr python
conda activate clicr
```

Then install the dependencies in Poetry:

```python
poetry install
```

You can now use the `clicr` in the CLI.
Check `clicr --help` for more information.

To run the documentation, run `mkdocs server` and check out the site at
`localhost:8000`.
