# Wacky

Wacca DataTable files loading + dumping lib

Specifically geared towards files :

- created by / for UE 4.19
- split in `.uasset` + `.uexp` pairs
- only containing DataTable exports

## Installing

```shell-session
pip install wacky
```

## Command Line Usage

### Unpacking

```shell-session
$ wacky unpack [OPTIONS] UASSET UEXP
```

This converts the useful data inside `UASSET` and `UEXP` to a yaml (or json) file you can edit and then use to repack

Options:
  - `--json` : Output json instead of yaml
  - `-o FILENAME`, `--output FILENAME` : Output to a specific file (instead of to stdout)
  - `--help`: Show a help message and exit.

### Modifying

Just use a text editor to change the file you've created with the previous command

### Repacking

```shell-session
$ wacky repack [OPTIONS] SRC_UASSET SRC_UEXP NEW_DATA DST_UASSET DST_UEXP
```

This creates new modified `.uasset` and `.uexp` files by using `SRC_UASSET` and `SRC_UEXP` as templates and applying the changes specified by `NEW_DATA`

Options:
  - `--help`: Show a help message and exit.

## Python API

```python
>>> from wacky import load, dump
>>> package = load(uasset=open(..., "rb"), uexp=open(..., "rb"))
>>> ... # Do stuff with `package`
>>> dump(package, uasset=open(..., "wb"), uexp=open(..., "wb"))
```
