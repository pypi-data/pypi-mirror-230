## Introduction
----
This software is used to identify candidate genes.
Here, we demonstrate the identification of the SCPLâ… A gene in Tieguanyin as an example, 
based on parameter thresholds for gene filtering.


## Install
----
### Preparation before use
Please ensure that you have installed BLAST and Hmmer software correctly before use.
You can execute the following two commands to test the software installation situation.

```shell
# Test blastp
blastp -version
# Test Hmmsearch
hmmsearch -h
```
