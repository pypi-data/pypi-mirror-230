# Notebooks

This directory contains notebooks of examples for how to use `scmdata`.

## Jupytext

We use [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) to encode the notebooks as standard .py files. This makes
it easier to version control notebooks as you get a clear, meaningful diffs. Jupytext also enables these notebooks
to be edited via Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. 

As part of the CI, these notebooks are run and checked for any errors.
