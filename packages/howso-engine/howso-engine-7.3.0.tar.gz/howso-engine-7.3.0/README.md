# Howso Engine&trade;

Howso Engine is an Understandable AI platform which is rooted in instance-based
machine learning and harnesses a fast spatial query system and information
theory for performance, accuracy, and auditability. With Howso, your data is
the model. As such, your data is stored in memory and predictions about a new
data point are made given its relationship to the original data. This enables
powerful decision making based on historical observations, augmented by rich
explanations to understand why those decisions were made. As an explainable AI
toolkit, Howso's interpretability features provide users opportunities to
evaluate which data contribute to predictions, identify similar data to the
predictions, and determine if new data and predictions are surprising compared
to the original data. Additional Howso capabilities include targetless
learning, allowing users to characterize and predict any set of variables,
real-time editing for online learning, data imputation, and discriminative and
generative modeling. By combining the features of Howso, users can analyze
their data in way not typically achievable using other state-of-the-art AI
techniques.
