HaSTL
=================================================================

HaSTL [ˈheɪstiɛl]: A fast GPU implementation of batched Seasonal and Trend
decomposition using Loess (STL) [1] with missing values and support for both
CUDA and OpenCL (C and multicore backends are also available).
Loosely based on `stlplus <https://github.com/hafen/stlplus>`_, a
popular library for the R programming language. The GPU code is written in
`Futhark <https://futhark-lang.org>`_, a functional language that compiles
to efficient parallel code.


Requirements
------------

You would need a working OpenCL or CUDA installation/header files, C compiler and these Python packages:

- futhark-ffi==0.14.2
- wheel


Installation
------------

You may want to run the program in a Python virtual environment. Create it via::

  python -m venv env

Then, activate the virtual environment via::

  . env/bin/activate

Upgrade pip via::

  pip install --upgrade pip

Then select the backends (choose from opencl, cuda, c and multicore) that you wish to build by setting the environment variable::

  export HASTL_BACKENDS="opencl multicore c" 

If no environmental variable is set, only the sequential c backend would be compiled.

The package can then be easily installed using pip. This will take a while, since we need
to compile the shared libraries for your particular system, Python implementation and all selected backends::

  pip install hastl

To install the package from the sources, first get the current stable release via::

  git clone https://github.com/mortvest/hastl

Install the dependencies via::

  pip install -r requirements.txt

Afterwards, you can install the package. This can also take a while::

  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  pip install .


Usage
-----
Examples of HaSTL usage can be found in the examples/ direcotry. The simplest snippet should contain::

  from hastl import STL
  stl = STL(backend=..)
  seasonal, trend, remainder = stl.fit(data, n_p=.., q_s=..)
