## Models

### GNNWR

[GNNWR](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2019.1707834) (Geographically neural network weighted regression) is a model address spatial non-stationarity in various domains with complex geographical processes. A spatially weighted neural network (SWNN) is proposed to represent the nonstationary weight matrix and to achieve local estimation by weighted least squares with this weights.

With the superior fitting ability of the neural network, GNNWR has a well-constructed nonstationary weight matrix, which makes it possible to better describe the complex geo-processes in environment and urban research.

### GTNNWR

[GTNNWR](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2020.1775836) (Geographically and temporally neural network weighted regression), is a model for estimating spatiotemporal non-stationary relationships.
Due to the existence of spatiotemporal non-stationary, the spatial relationships of features exhibit significant differences with changes in spatiotemporal structure.
The calculation of spatiotemporal distance is an important aspect of solving spatiotemporal non-stationary problems. 
Therefore, this model introduces spatiotemporal distance into the GNNWR model and proposes a spatiotemporal proximity neural network (STPNN) to accurately calculate spatiotemporal distance. 
Collaborate with SWNN in the GNNWR model to calculate the spatiotemporal non-stationary weight matrix, thereby achieving accurate modeling of spatiotemporal non-stationary relationships.

## Install

**⚠ If you want to run gnnwr with your GPU, make sure you have installed *pytorch with CUDA support* beforehead:**

For example, a torch 1.13.1 with cuda 11.7:

``` bash
> pip list | grep torch
torch                   1.13.1+cu117
```

You can find install support on [Pytorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/)  for installing the right version that suits your environment.

**⚠ If you only want to run gnnwr with your CPU, or you have already installed the correct version of pytorch:**

Using pip to install gnnwr:  

```
pip install gnnwr
```

## Usage

We provide a series of encapsulated methods and predefined default parameters, users only need to use to load dataset with `pandas` , and call the functions in `gnnwr` package to complete the regression:

```python
from gnnwr import models,datasets
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset = datasets.init_dataset(data=data,
                                                                 test_ratio=0.2, valid_ratio=0.1,
                                                                 x_column=['x1', 'x2'], y_column=['y'],
                                                                 spatial_column=['u', 'v'])

gnnwr = models.GNNWR(train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset)

gnnwr.run(100)
```

## Research Cases

### Environment

#### Air quality

Air pollution, especially the measurement of PM2.5, has recently been a popular researching topic in China. Using the data of PM2.5 which is collected by separated station and Considering the complicated terrain variability and wide geographical scope in China, the work of estimating and mapping the PM2.5 distributions across China with high accuracy and reasonable details is challenged by significant spatial nonstationary and complex nonlinearity. GNNWR model can obtain spatially continuous PM2.5 estimates in China with the processed data of AOD, DEM, as well as some climate factors. The estimation of PM2.5 is closer to the ground observation than the results of traditional regression model, and it is more accurate in the high value zone and more detailed.

#### Water quality

Transferring dissolved silicate (DSi) from land to coastal environments is vital for global biogeochemical cycling. Yet pinpointing coastal DSi distribution is complex due to spatiotemporal variability, nonlinear modeling, and low sampling resolution. GTNNWR model, by converting the spatiotemporal relationships between sparse sampling points and unknown points into space-time distances and weights, and using neural networks to determine the nonlinear distances and nonstationary weights, outperforms traditional regression models in both fitting accuracy and generalization ability. This effective data-driven-based method can help explore the fine-scale dynamic changes in coastal seas like surface DSi. 

### Urban

#### House price

Housing prices are closely related to the lives of new urban residents, and they also comprise a vital economic index to which the government needs to pay close attention. Compare with traditional regression models, GNNWR and GTNNWR model can improve the accuracy of real estate appraisal with the help of neural networks, which are practical and powerful ways to assess house prices.

Further, these model can be applied to other valuation problems concerning geographical data to promote the prediction accuracy of socioeconomic phenomena.
