    The base metric class for all metrics in Hezar.

    Metrics are simple wrappers for casual ready-to-use metrics like in scikit-learn, etc. and it's strongly recommended
    not to reinvent the wheel. If a metric is already implemented by some package, use it! The only reason to implement
    such a module, is to make sure the metrics are treated the same all over the framework.
