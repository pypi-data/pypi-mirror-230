# Netbox Sync Status

[Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox) plugin that adds the capability to report system sync status backup to NetBox


It works by having the user create a number of `Sync Systems`, each sync system can then report back a `Sync Status` for a device, so that the end user will be able to see how it went. 

A full log of how all sync's went is saved so you can go back in history and view errors if needed.
