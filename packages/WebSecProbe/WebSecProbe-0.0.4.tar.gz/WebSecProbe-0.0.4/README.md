WebSecProbe is designed to perform a series of HTTP requests to a target URL with various payloads in order to test for potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

- It takes user input for the target URL and the path.
- It defines a list of payloads that represent different HTTP request variations, such as URL-encoded characters, special headers, and different HTTP methods.
- It iterates through each payload and constructs a full URL by appending the payload to the target URL.
- For each constructed URL, it sends an HTTP GET request using the requests library, and it captures the response status code and content length.
- It prints the constructed URL, status code, and content length for each request, effectively showing the results of each variation's response from the target server.
- After testing all payloads, it queries the Wayback Machine (a web archive) to check if there are any archived snapshots of the target URL/path. If available, it prints the closest archived snapshot's information.
