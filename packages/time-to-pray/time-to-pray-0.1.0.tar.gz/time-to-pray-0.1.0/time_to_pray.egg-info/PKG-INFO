===============

**Time to Pray** is a desktop utility designed to keep you informed about Islamic prayer times. Directly from your system tray, view a real-time countdown to the next prayer.

Stay on track with your prayer commitments, knowing the exact time remaining until the next call.

Features
--------

*   Real-time countdown to the next prayer, accessible from the system tray.
*   Proactively fetches the monthly prayer schedule based on your configured location.
*   Easy-to-access "Settings" dialog for configuring your preferred city and selecting your desired prayer times calculation method.
*   Utilizes PyQt6 for a seamless user interface experience.

python src/main.py
```

Once launched, an icon will appear in your system tray. Right-click the icon to access the settings or hover to view the detailed countdown.

Configuration
-------------

The application uses the `settings.json` file for configuration. You can use the "Settings" dialog in the application or manually edit this file (not recommended). The configuration parameters are:

*   `city`: The city you are located in.
*   `country`: The country name or code (e.g., "tr" for Turkey).
*   `latitude` & `longitude`: The geographical coordinates of your location. The application automatically fetches these from the API based on the specified city and country.
*   `method`: The method used to calculate prayer times.
